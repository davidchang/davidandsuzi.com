					<ol reversed>
						<li>Because we haven't had a date night in more than a year</li>
						<li>Because I want to see what color the walls of our condo get painted</li>
						<li>For your guitar, Martin (Sorry baby... I can't pretend like it's not an extra incentive!)</li>
						<li>Because you are a phenomenal chef and, rice with water aside, I'm certain that I will love your cooking so much that I'll eat everything and we will never have leftovers</li>
						<li>Because you make me feel understood, even without either of us saying anything</li>
						<li>So we can finally be together! Live in the same house, interact on a physical, daily basis, and have the same friends</li>
						<li>So that I'll be able to show you all of the things that I've seen over the past several months. I'll be able to introduce you to my community of believers as well as an excessive number of sushi restaurants</li>
						<li>So we can finally just talk in person instead of on the phone or Skype. I think we'll have significantly fewer dropped calls when we're in the same room as one another</li>
						<li>Because Community is going to start soon and it wouldn't make sense to watch it out without you</li>
						<li>Because I learn the most random (and often very important) things from you every day - and I love it</li>
						<li>So that you don't have to be in such humid weather (Tulsa had a high of 112 today... Point made)</li>
						<li>So my condo can be furnished! I can't wait to sleep on a bed again - and next to you, nonetheless!</li>
						<li>So we can finally open those wedding registry presents... They're just sitting in a corner of the living room!</li>
						<li>Because you are stop-and-stare beautiful</li>
						<li>Because your heart is also stop-and-stare beautiful, a flower in perpetual bloom</li>
						<li>Because my hands have been dying to give a back massage to someone and I'd like it to be you</li>
						<li>So I don't have to get frozen yogurt by myself anymore</li>
						<li>Because "It is not good for man to be alone" and "Two is better than one." I can't wait for your companionship in marriage, the silly adventures and memories we'll make, the spontaneous chaos that will forge a priceless relationship</li>
						<li>Because your smile is contagious, affirming, and humbling. All at once, I can't help but reciprocate a smile, feel my heart skip a beat, and wonder that God would trust me to lead His own daughter, made in His own image</li>
						<li>So I can watch after you spiritually and wash you with the Word, to present you pure and blameless before God</li>
						<li>So I can be sanctified by God with you in marriage, as rough as that will be</li>
						<li>For I simply want to know you better - your thoughts, your quirks, your character. Your personality is unmistakably attractive</li>
						<li>For I can see God resonating in you and it is Him in you that gives me so much freedom to be myself, as clumsy, accident-prone, and introverted as I can be. You help me understand more tangibly the character of God in the grace, truth, forgiveness, joy, and commitment you extend to me</li>
						<li>To glorify God</li>
