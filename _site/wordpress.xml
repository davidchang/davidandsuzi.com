		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi guys! This is David, delivering the website itself and the first blog post, as Suzi doesn't yet know that this site has been built. She's off on her first mission trip in Nicaragua with our college church group and I'm stuck in Seattle, Washington, some 4000 miles away.

Most of this is pretty surreal for me, to be honest. Suzi and I had been dating for 3 years when I proposed, and things were pretty admittedly amazing - there were times of edifying each other and extending grace and patience and understanding and companionship - but things weren't always like we were walking on rainbows. We had even broken up in the midst of that second year - and went nearly 4 months without any contact or communication. We broke up because we disagreed about marriage. I felt like we weren't ready on a few different levels - mostly spiritually and financially. Suzi felt like we were ready - we were past ready - and that marriage shouldn't be delayed simply on the basis of financial circumstances. I definitely give her credit for that - she was content to be with me, even if things were going to be rough, if we would be living paycheck to paycheck.

I didn't share the same mentality though. I figured I should be in a position to provide and be financially independent and have my act together spiritually - and until I checked these off of a checklist, I wasn't really qualified to move forward. I didn't have a job coming out of college. I honestly didn't feel like a man and didn't feel very independent, like I could actually provide for someone and lead them in relationship with God. I simply didn't know if I could do it. I could identify areas in my life that weren't what they were supposed to be spiritually - I was pretty unstable in my relationship with God. I wasn't in the Word or in prayer like I had been in the past, I didn't feel like I was seeing a lot of fruit or stepping out in faith. So I postponed marriage in my mind as some distant, abstract thing... whenever I get my act together, then marriage will be an option. <!--more-->

In that second year, in the course of less than two weeks, Suzi and I broke up, I learned that I had been rejected from a graduate program I had almost already finished, I forfeited my college job at the <a href="http://k20center.ou.edu/" title="K20 Center" target="_blank">K20 Center</a>, moved out of my apartment in Norman and back home to Tulsa, gotten on a plane to California, and then to Southeast Asia for a mission trip with <a href="http://www.epicmovement.com/" title="Epic movement" target="_blank">Epic</a>. Though I was on a mission trip with a team I now consider family, it was about a month into the trip until I was able to unload my emotional baggage. In that process, though - a lot changed. My confidence, composure, demeanor seemed to change - I felt God's proximity. Though I had been freaking out about my job situation, I had a job offer just 5 or 6 weeks later at a <a href="http://www.stylesays.com/" title="StyleSays" target="_blank">startup</a>, and so I flew out soon afterward with a one-way ticket to San Francisco.

There, I think I realized that I could get married if I wanted to. I realized that I could provide and lead - and I simply didn't know this. I knew it abstractly, in my head, that God had designed me to be strong and courageous and masculine - but moving away, living on my own, working 60 to 70 hours a week - I realized I was strong, courageous, masculine. I could do it. I saw God's provision - in an intensely cheap apartment that was within walking distance, an apartment that gave me completely private roof access with an unparalleled view of the city. I found all of my furniture for free through Craigslist. God was opening doors, showing Himself active in my life.

Two months later and I was burning out. I distinctly remember my last day of work, since I had only actually signed on for a two month contract, though I think we were both expecting it to be extended. There was uncertainty and panic, wondering if I had made a terrible mistake. That next week, I flew to Seattle for an interview with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" title="Amazon" target="_blank">Amazon</a> - I remember pacing my Bellevue hotel room, praying that God would open or close the door. About a week later, I had an offer in my inbox - and two weeks later, I was in transit to Washington with a one-way ticket in hand.

Now... everything I had against marriage had been eliminated. Additionally, I had a distinct desire for marriage - I believed I would be able to stand and lead spiritually, and I'd be making more than I could have dreamed of. I really felt like... this wasn't a mistake. Suzi and I had started talking again, and I had expressed my feelings for marriage.

And so, about three months later, I was back in Tulsa for the weekend and on one knee to propose.

Those have been my past 9 months. Now, in 5 months (and 1 day), I'll be watching Suzi walk down the aisle, and I'll be able to kiss the bride. Afterwards, we'll live in a condo in Redmond, Washington and attend church at <a href="http://krucial206.org/" title="Chinese Southern Baptist Church" target="_blank">Chinese Southern Baptist Church</a> in the Chinatown of Seattle. As for me - what can I really say? God has given me beauty for ashes, life instead of death - just as my life has been redeemed by Him, my relationship with Suzi has been redeemed and breathed into by His mercy and grace. May I be more like Him and desire more of Him each day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Perhaps the most unfortunate thing about marriage is coming face to face with the realization that I'm not the person I'm supposed to be. Someone else gets access to my flesh, to my dark thoughts and slip ups and selfishness, my embarrassing and shameful mistakes from the past, the sin that only fully emerges behind closed doors. Try as hard as I can - I have to understand how these inadequacies don't quite go away. As I count the days until our wedding and hope that the dwindling number will instill in me an urgency to change... I find that the number itself gives me little reason to change. As we learned in premarital counseling, absolutely nothing changes the moment we say, "I do." [And, at the same time, absolutely everything changes, over time.]

Who is the man that I'm supposed to be? I think I should be a man confident in his own manhood, leading and taking responsibility, protecting and providing, leaving and cleaving, making tough decisions, being on top of things, washing my wife with the Word and loving her selflessly, admitting my mistakes and buying peonies when I needed to apologize. I'm not sure who I thought I would be at this point, 3 weeks to the wedding. I'm sure I thought I would be reading my Bible every day and that my prayer life would be heightened. I'm sure I thought I would have a lot to say about theology and all sorts of random things and that I would know how to cook a few good meals and that I'd understand how to fix something when it broke. I think the problem, though, is that we tend to like the idea of becoming people like this, but we typically have no interest in putting in the work or whatever is required to actually change in that direction. [Or that we have excessive self-esteem and no God-esteem, and we swing fully in the opposite direction - eliminating God from the picture and reducing everything to a matter of our own wills.]

But I guess it's also worth saying that we're never quite ready. I don't think there's a point at which we hit sufficiency and marriage is no longer a ride, no less risky, no less frightening.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My Facebook and Google Interviews</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Note: This is not meant to be published.

Before I forgot everything that happened, I'm going to recap on my experiences for the Facebook and Google interviews I had on 10/19 and 11/2 respectively.

Facebook

I had one onsite interview at Facebook Seattle (a few blocks from Amazon) after meeting a recruiter at a tech talk and going through an initial, nontechnical phone screen. The onsite was an hour long with a Chinese guy who had moved over from Microsoft and had been working on the backend for Messages. He asked two basic questions, and then I heard back about a week later that I wouldn't be moving on.

The first question was, given two sorted arrays of integers, print out all of the duplicates. If there were multiple occurrences of the same duplicate (like 2 2's appeared in both arrays), then print both of them: 2 2''s. After doing this, he changed the problem specification and asked what I could do to print out only each occurrence of the duplicates, regardless of how many times both appeared (so 2 2's would only print out 1 2). For this, I added a variable to keep track of the last duplicate encountered. But I didn't know what to do for the very first element, and the interviewer pointed out that setting the first duplicate encountered to something like x[0] - 1 would throw an error if x[0] was Integer.MIN_VALUE. He suggested that I should have used the index of the last duplicate encountered, and I said that it would complicate the business logic a bit, and he agreed.

The second question he asked was more C++-esque. Even the method signature he gave was using a pointer, and so I knew I was a bit out of my element. He gave me a method signature that read like this: readFile(fh fileHandle, char* buf) that read 4000 bytes from the fileHandle and returned the number of bites that were read. If the file was > 4000, it would only read 4000 bytes and then return the number 4000, and if the file was < 4000, it would only read that much into buf and return the number of bytes read.

The problem was to implement a new function, readFile(fh fileHandle, char* buf, int size) that would allow the user to specify any size, but it would be implemented using the earlier function that could only read 4000 at a time. I implemented using a while loop and switched everything over to Java, but I copied from one buffer to another and the interviewer pointed out that the second buffer might not be able to hold as much as the first buffer. I felt like this was pointing at language specific details that I wasn't very comfortable with.

Afterwards, I felt good, thinking that I hadn't really done anything that would prevent me from moving on. I was told I'd hear back the next Monday or Tuesday (interview was on a Friday), but it actually ended up being the next Monday when I heard back.

As for Google, I had two hour long interviews at their Kirkland offices on 11/2.

My first interviewer, Andrey, was Russian and had a full beard. He had worked on the Webmaster Tools frontend for like 6 years and then had spent the last year working on Google Cloud stuff. He asked me to validate a Sudoku solution, a 9x9 grid, where some of the spaces were filled in and some of the unfilled spaces were represented with 0's. He asked for time and memory complexity. He then asked me how my code would change if the radix was 2 instead of 3, so I was dealing with a 4x4 grid. He then asked how my code would change if the Sudoku grid was 3 dimensional. He then asked how things would change if the Sudoku grid was n dimensional.

Then he asked how I would represent a data structure for that n dimensional Sudoku in Java, and I mentioned that it would do well in a statically typed language like PHP where you can stuff arrays with anything you want, but he asked how I would do it in Java. I stumbled and gave something like this:

<pre>
public class Dimension {
List<Dimension> dimensions;
something to store data here
}
</pre>

Afterwards, he asked me to devise an algorithm (not necessarily write code) that would, given a dictionary and a string, determine if the string could be split into 2 different valid words (as defined in the dictionary). He then asked how things would change if the string could be split into n words, and the algorithm I had come up with was revealed to be exponential. I suggested the dictionary could be stored as a trie and that you would iterate through the string and if you found a word, then you would try the same approach with the "rest of the word," while also branching off in case the "rest of the word" couldn't be resolved into valid dictionary words. He helped me along though, asking if we could do better than exponential and asking what about the problem was causing it to be exponential.

My second interviewer was a guy who had come from Amazon and had been working on Dremel, a system that allows querying of massive log files in real time (like it processes a petabyte worth of logs in a matter of minutes). We talked at length about Amazon and work-life balance and the stuff I've worked on in the past year - we started the first 20 minutes talking about it.

His first question was to implement an iterator given a stream of numbers where the first number would represent the occurrences of the second number. So if the stream was 3 8 2 10 0 9 1 50, then the output expected from the iterator would be 8 8 8 10 10 50. I wrote the next() and hasNext() functions and it went pretty smoothly.

The second question was to design a system and write a function that would take 2 four letter words and return a boolean if they formed a word ladder (meaning 1 letter can be changed to form a valid word multiple times until you arrive at a target word). I spoke about preprocessing and gave a solution where every four letter word is connected to a trie of all possible words it forms a word latter with (not immediate neighbors, but all neighbors), so that latency would be particularly low. I said the database would be something like a key value, NoSQL schemaless solution. I wrote the preprocessing code to fill that database, but wasn't able to do it exhaustively.

12/7 - My second/final interviews with Google - I went back in to the Kirkland office for two more interviews and then an informal, non-feedback-submitted lunch interview. The interviews were supposed to be the final round and yet were surprisingly easier than even the first two. I'm a bit confused and even a little agitated.

My first interview was with a guy named Justin who was working on media elements in Chrome. He had been there for about a year and a half and was from Canada. He asked initially how to find the median of three numbers. I had read the question on Glassdoor, but I couldn't recall the answer. I remembered it as I drove back - I should have only needed 2 comparisons.

(a-b)(c-a) < 0 would mean a is the median. (b-a)(c-b) < 0 would mean b is the median. else, c is the median.

Instead, I said the elementary, brute force solution would take 8 comparisons and mentioned that I knew of some kind of mathematical property that would decrease down to 2 comparisons.

He then asked about finding the median of a list of n integers, at which point I mentioned that one could do a modified quicksort that would take average time of O(n) based on average selected pivots, but could take O(n^2) for poorly chosen pivots. I couldn't figure out how to optimize on that.

Then he asked about how to determine from a String what pages to print for a printer (the user could type in something like 1-5,8-9,10-12 and would want to print those pages, and if they added 2-5, we wouldn't want to print redundant pages again). I talked about using an array or a Long (where you set the bits) and he asked for something that could accommodate more in size. I mentioned lists or hash tables, saying a list would take some retrieval time, then just said I should use a set (and resolved on a tree set, so everything would be sorted). He had me code it up. He then asked to back up and asked for a different way of solving the problem, then we later compared the two. I said we could store the individual intervals in a list, but then it would be more complicated to write/error prone, but it would take less space and be potentially faster in terms of time complexity. He had me write a doesOverlap function between 2 intervals and then asked how that merging would take place if it doesOverlap.

After that, I had another interviewer named Greg who worked in infrastructure and had been doing a PhD in computer languages (he really liked Scheme, was somewhat offended at Go). He only asked me one question, in which he defined an Iterator interface (with hasNext and next functions) and a Predicate interface (with boolean accepts function) and asked me to write a function with this signature: Iterator<T> filter(Iterator<T> in, Predicate<T> p). The trick was to implement a myIterator class that extended Iterator<T> and make in and p fields in that Iterator, then to modify that hasNext and next functionality of myIterator. I mistook it and wanted to pass through everything in "in" and write it to a new Iterator. It took me a while to determine what he was really saying and where he was leading me. I was not upset, but a little taken aback.

That was the only question he asked me :/ We then talked about distributed systems and some of my work at Amazon and some problems regarding availability and replicated data stores, like transactions in databases and sending messages and what would happen if you committed the transaction and your service crashed before sending the message. I said stuff about idempotency and he seemed fine with it. And... that was it. He let me ask him some questions. It was hard to tell how I had done, and his body language somewhat indicated that he wasn't too happy.

Then I had a lunch interview that was pretty standard. The guy talked a lot about the different benefits and bonuses that are available at Google and some of the different teams in Kirkland, then said that the review committee meets every Wednesday and decides whether they're inclined to hire. Also said that every new hire spends a week of orientation down in Mountain View, so that sounded pretty good. At the same time, the cafeteria food was somewhat mediocre and I wondered how good of a fit the Kirkland office would be. Overall, I'm still pretty impressed, with Google being Google, but I'm a bit distraught that I wasn't asked harder questions and that I'll have to wait the next 2 or 3 weeks to hear back from them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi guys - it's been a while since the last post. The site has gone through a hopefully nicer, simpler redesign (though no one except Aaron Coffey and a handful of others saw the first one).

Things have been going pretty well on my end. I think Suzi's been doing well, wrapping up school and going through her last assignments. This wedding planning thing really is stressful, and I readily admit I've been of almost no help. I really have no idea what's going on. But hopefully things will change a little this weekend.

I'm in Tulsa for the weekend (just flew in today) for a bunch of wedding preparations. We'll be doing engagement pictures, registries, wedding bands, etc. Suzi's bridal shower is even this weekend! We'll be driving all over (Arkansas, Norman) and I'll get to enjoy my birthday this Saturday zapping items from Bed, Bath, and Beyond (and, of course, I'm most excited for that Beyond section). We'll also get to go to our first wedding together (as if that is a milestone) - one of my church friends, Chance Hawkins, is getting married tomorrow.

Things have been pretty all right though. Work has been going well - I've been given more responsibility over the past few weeks, though, which means that I get more stressed out. I kinda counteract that with rock climbing - I got a bouldering membership to the <a href="http://seattleboulderingproject.com" title="Seattle Bouldering Project">Seattle Bouldering Project</a>, so I've been going in the mornings before work. But I'm a bit more out of it when it comes to continuing to develop and establish relationships.<!--more-->

Church life has still been flourishing though, and I think my welcoming into a church has made the transition to a new city so smooth/manageable. I've connected with a bunch of guys, bonding over food, late nights playing games, and weekend afternoons playing flag football and basketball. It's been great to see people begin to talk about how they will include Suzi as well - how they can't wait to meet her, how she can be integrated into the community, how we could even have a Bible study for married couples! Things have been good in that regard.

Other than that, I can't wait for Suzi to get here and for us to be able to spend time together. I can't wait for the trips to IKEA to fill the empty condo (I'm hoping for a long, dark wood dining table) and for the legitimate meals (I'm terrible at exerting the energy to cook for myself... and I think I'm painting a pretty bad picture of myself right now). Most of all, I just can't wait for Suzi to be there with me. While we've been able to make a long distance relationship work over the past few months... I think things will be pretty ideal to finally be together, wholly, completely.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey guys - I'm back in Washington, getting a post in between climbing and work. It's Friday, which means Friday night fellowship and a Japanese themed after-dinner from Lisa... which means that I will be thinking about tonight all day. But anyways - I had a truly great time in Oklahoma this past weekend, so I thought I would get in a quick recap for nostalgic purposes.

Wednesday (5/2) - I flew back to Oklahoma, sitting on the plane next to a couple who had been married for 62 years. They gave me some advice. I got back around 6:30 and my mom and I went to a newly opened Vietnamese restaurant (that opened right next to China Star, a restaurant I grew up on, that had recently closed down :/)

Thursday (5/3) - I hit a run at Holland Hall and saw my old computer science teacher, Mr. Ford. The weather was brutal. Suzi came back and we went shopping briefly for engagement picture clothes, then went to Chance Hawkin's wedding! At Camp Loughridge. Then a reception following at a different site downtown. Then a little more shopping.

Friday (5/4) - Suzi and I did our <a href="http://www.target.com/RegistryGiftGiverCmd?isPreview=false&status=completePageLink&listId=ptr18eBq261Y1P7zmG4LSQ&registryType=WD&isAjax=false" title="Target Registry">Target registry</a>, finished more last minute shopping (we're either terribly inefficient, or trying to buy all of the clothes I failed to buy over the past few years), then rushed down to Siloam Springs, Arkansas, about a two hour drive, where we met with a photographer named <a href="http://www.mileswittboyer.com/" title="Miles Witt Boyer">Miles Witt Boyer</a>. Suzi's cousin and maid of honor, Kaley, showed up as well, and we were able to have dinner afterwards at a Thai place. The photo shoot was about 2 hours long, cut off a little short by rain. Suzi was laughing nonstop for about the first twenty minutes, but both of us really did have a good time and were really glad that we went with Miles. We drove back to Tulsa and even had enough time to buy our wedding bands (okay, it really only took like 15 minutes).

Saturday (5/5) - Breakfast with Suzi's brother, Peter, which was good because I never really got to know him. Afterwards, my mom and sister went over to meet with Suzi's family for a wedding planning session, which I think was pretty productive (I hope). It was good to see our families work together and interact. Suzi and I then went to do a registry at <a href="http://www1.macys.com/registry/wedding/guest/?registryId=16412" title="Macy's Registry">Macy's</a>, buy a charcoal suit at Men's Wearhouse, do our registry at <a href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/regGiftRegistry.asp?wrn=-213430246&" title="Bed, Bath, and Beyond Registry">Bed, Bath, and Beyond</a>, then pack up and leave for Norman. Once we got there, we met up with Dallas and Hannah at Braum's for dinner/ice cream, then rushed over to meet a few people from our Epic Bible study to watch Avengers! And it was pretty good, but we didn't get out until 12:30am. Suzi and I went back to Camelot (my old apartment with Joey, Drew, and Paul) to hang out, then I took Suzi back to her apartment. Joey and I then talked past 4 in the morning.

Sunday (5/6) - College Life at Wildwood! Suzi spoke on a panel of graduating seniors, giving advice to everyone else. I actually really enjoyed what Suzi had to say and really thought it was worth saying, and vulnerable at the same time. It was great to see how far she has come over the past four years and how she has really made an effort to become a part of a community - this year alone, Suzi led worship nearly every Sunday, attended two ministry retreats, and went to Nicaragua over spring break with College Life. That, on top of weekly discipleship and Bible study through Wildwood (not to mention one through Epic). I've been really impressed. After church, we went back to Suzi's to pack my suitcases with her stuff, then we parted ways. I had lunch at Asian Buffet with James, then hung out with Drew and Paul briefly before heading back.

Monday (5/7) - I woke up early and climbed, and then was so exhausted that I was basically unproductive all day. I went home and slept at 6:30pm and didn't wake up until 6:30am.

And that is the story of our weekend! Exciting stuff :) I'll try to get Suzi to post on here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week is finals week and graduation weekend!! As I write this, Commencement is going on right now. I decided not to go because I don't see the point of going if my name isn't going to be called. Fireworks don't really motivate me either haha. I also have to find my cap and gown. It's somewhere in my closet. I hope in 5-10 years from now, I'm still really relaxed. 

I finished my last final/jury Tuesday and have so much freedom, I don't even know what to do with it! The past few days had been a blur, I don't remember what I did with my time at all. My mind is still in school mode. I do things in a hurry and feel like I constantly have things to do, but when I take the time to slow down and think, I realize I don't have anything to do! No deadlines, no meetings, no last minute practicing. It's a breath of fresh air! This chapter is coming to a close and I think it is a smooth transition into the next chapter. 

It's weird to think that I may never see my friends ever again once I graduate and get married! I don't know the next time I'll hang out with my bible study girls, interact with my friends and family, or see the little kids who have captured my heart at Wildwood. It definitely hasn't hit me yet.

Although I may miss the things that are behind, I also can't help but be joyful for the things ahead. I can't wait to get married. I am so eager to wear my wedding band! Secretly, I take it out of the box, put it on, and admire how wonderful it looks with my engagement ring...but most importantly, how it will symbolize our commitment to each other in marriage. I'll admit (because I know David won't sacrifice his man card saying this) I can't wait for us to wake up next to each other every morning, I can't wait to cuddle on the couch and watch a movie on a rainy Seattle night, I can't wait to give him a big hug after he comes home from work, and I can't wait to go on dates! I haven't been on a date in so long! I can't wait to eat yummy food, see things I've never seen before, and have a picnic in perfect weather. Most of all, I can't wait for the night we don't have to say goodbye after a date! There is so much freedom in marriage :)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The next 106 days will fly by. 106 days left of my season of singleness. In the next 3 hours, it's going to be 105! My prayer for the next few months is to slow down and enjoy it all. I want to be aware of what the Lord is showing me. I want to see how he's preparing my heart for marriage and the significance of it all. I want to walk into marriage equipped.

The next few months are also going to be filled with DIY crafts! I have a list if all the things I want to make for the wedding. It'll be my ultimate DIY project. Hopefully, it'll be a time full of life and richness instead of stress. 

I have 7 weeks left until my lease ends in Norman. That means 7 weeks left of discipleship, 7 weeks of my weekly Goodwill trips, 7 weeks left of work, and 7 weeks of meeting up with Norman friends. Ashley Nguyen and I are planning on meeting every week. She has voiced her desire to grow in the Lord, and I am determined to walk with her in these next few weeks. We will probably go through a book together, though I don't know which one yet. I admire her vulnerability and her willingness to learn and grow. I haven't seen that in a while.

Every Friday night, David goes to church and we skip a night of talking. Before, if David was going to do something without me, I would feel uneasy and jealous. But now, it brings me joy because he needs community and friends beyond being with me all the time! It's great to know that he desires to go to church and create relationships/biblical community. It's cool to see our relationship move from a selfish, self-centered relationship (a year ago) to a God-glorifying, healthy relationship. I love seeing the Lord's blessing upon our relationship. Every step of the way, we have seen His approval. I pray that we will continuously surrender the foolish things of this world and cast our eyes on everything that is of Him. To see that everything on earth is merely a shadow of the greatness that is to come.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[David has been telling me to write a post on the website for the past few weeks now, and I hope it makes him really happy when he finds that I have posted 3!

I think it's always fun when people confess entertaining little secrets, so I'll share some of mine! 

Confession #1: When David and I broke up last year, I would check up on how he was doing by going on his blog. One day when I accidentally ran into him at the Huff, we caught up on life and he told me that he started a new blog. I secretly memorized it and checked it everyday. Totally not creepy at all.

Confession #2: A couple years ago, I took one of David's jackets... And it is in my closet to this day.

Confession #3: I'm glad David has different glasses now because I always thought the glasses he had before was too small for his head. Sorry David :/

Confession #4: The reason why it takes me so long to blog is because I struggle with using proper grammar. Why is English so hard lol

Confession #5: I think David is a robot because his baby pictures look too perfect.

This is all for now. Can't confess it all in one night! ;)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Eek - wow. It's a Friday @ 5:34 and I'm in that anxious stage between being off for the weekend and going to church, so I thought I might as well put together a quick blog post. Most of my life is still pretty routine - I just go to church on the weekdays and I go to church on the weekends. I might rock climb in the mornings and eat something from Trader Joe's at nights, then talk to Suzi for some amount of time. Sometimes we don't talk until late - so late that Suzi finds herself in a weird half-dream state, where she only dreams that she's communicating with me.

We've finally gotten our marital counseling figured out, which meant that we had homework recently. We had to go online and fill out a quiz of about 250 of those "Rate from 1 to 5 to Strongly Disagree or Agree" questions, covering all sorts of topics like family upbringing and background and how we spent time together or how we felt about finances. To be honest, I'm really nervous about counseling because I'm afraid that at our first session, Jeremy Horton (our college pastor) will pull out the results to our online quizzes and tell me that I failed. And that I'm no longer allowed to marry Suzi.

But yes - things have been good lately. I'm still really enjoying the community that I've been able to find at church, the transparency I can show, and the truth that others will hold me to keep. I'm glad that I've been able to get so involved and feel like a leader, though it's been less than 6 months. As stats have shown Seattle as one of the most unchurched regions in the nation, perhaps that is a reason I've been so encouraged - I go to church with a bunch of guys who didn't grow up in church. Almost all of the core leadership grew up in nonChristian homes with nonChristian parents - two brothers even brought their parents to faith. A good friend named Fred (he's providing the music for Suzi and my wedding!) is the only Christian in his family and will be going to San Francisco this fall, against his family's will, to attend seminary and study missions, with the goal of becoming a missionary to an unreached people group.

Being around people like that helps me see that people with no Christian background, no Christian upbringing, still yearn for Christ. It's a rather nice defense against people who believe that we only believe what we're sociologically set up to believe. At the same time, being around people who pursue God out of desperation and understanding of what their lives were like before Christ reminds me where my hope and strength needs to lie. I can't allow myself to grow in pride, because I really can't allow myself to desire self-sufficiency, though I tend to perpetually drift in that direction.

With that said, I pray I can grow and learn and lead a Christ-centered life and that I wouldn't be so foolish to think a marriage or a life can stand apart from Him. I pray I take each of these next 78 days slowly.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Stop Facebook - a Chrome extension</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let's be honest. I'm a bit addicted to Facebook. I visit the site many times an hour, for many hours a day, for basically every day of the year.

Why is it so hard to unplug from Facebook? Some of my reluctance is because I want to legitimately stay connected - but most of it is just me wasting time. So I took a few hours and wrote Stop Facebook, a browser plugin.

It started with realizing the ways that I use Facebook - when am I using it "productively" and when am I wasting time?

Notifications are a good sign of productive usage. When I have notifications, I feel somewhat justified to use Facebook. When I don't have notifications (and haven't for some time), then there's a good chance I'm just wasting time.

I also move around a lot. I stay on the same Facebook page for very short amounts of time, but move from my news feed to some random person, back and forth, all day. That's probably a sign of wasting time.

I also realize that I'll open a Facebook window, check my news feed, close out of it, then find myself doing the exact same thing 30 seconds later. I am constantly opening and closing Facebook tabs at work.

With this usage in mind, I wrote Stop Facebook. It should let me be on Facebook when I am using it to stay connected. It should kick me off when I'm wasting time.

Here are the basic ways it works:
<ol>
	<li>If you have notifications, it will always let you onto Facebook. Each notification gives you a certain amount of time you can be on Facebook.</li>
	<li>If you don't have any notifications and you haven't been on Facebook in the past 3 hours, you can be on Facebook for the next 3 minutes.</li>
	<li>You will only get kicked off of Facebook on actual page reloads. Facebook doesn't actually reload the page when you're navigating around - so it won't interrupt you in the middle of a wall post or message. Once you've used your time up, it will still only be able to kick you off if you refresh the page or close and reopen Facebook (which I do frequently).</li>
</ol>

You can download the extension by clicking <a href="http://davidandsuzi.com/misc/stop-facebook.crx">here</a> and view the source on Github <a href="https://github.com/davidchang/stop-facebook">here</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A week ago, I had the privilege of leading a newly formed guy's Bible study for church, focusing on our own life stories. I facilitated by choosing a few topics, then letting everyone share for a minute or two about that topic - and this would help guide us as we told our stories. We started from the beginning, talking about out parents, childhoods, and lives before submitting to Christianity. Then we transitioned into what changed us and led us to Christ, the people who had changed us, and how we had been doing since then.

As we reflected, a few major themes prevailed. We stopped to ponder the people we had been before we knew Christ and the trajectory we were headed towards - then the interruption of God's grace in our lives, the fortune of our pride being impossibly broken - broken enough to recognize our need for a Savior and to know that Savior in Christ.

As Chris drove me home, he asked who I thought I would have become if I had never become a real Christian. I acknowledged that I had been on a pretty bad trajectory in life - that if I was a spectator of my own life, I would be worried for myself. I could've ended up a pretty bad kid. I would do anything for a laugh or attention - I didn't really have moral standards. I cared for shallow things - the reputation, the grade - regardless of the internal conditions. It didn't matter if I was smart if no one knew it or if my GPA didn't reflect it. Not only did I care about things that didn't matter - I cared about them a lot. I often questioned what the point of doing something was if I couldn't be the best. And if I wasn't the best - which I dreadfully knew to be true - what was the point of trying?

In my mind, that was the only thing that mattered, the only thing that fueled anyone who ever lived. We were all trying to be the best... and if we weren't, we faded out of history. That was secretly my conviction. But also my downfall - it was entirely impractical and severely unforgiving.

My solution wasn't to ease up on my standards. Fortunately - I didn't have to. I became known by God, and He offered the escape I had sought after in porn and reputation and grades. One day in Mexico City, I struggled in my understanding that I simply wasn't good enough to be loved and accepted by God. Later that night, I found much needed rest in Jesus as the reason and certainty that I was good enough <a href="http://bib.ly/1Jo2.1">http://bib.ly/1Jo2.1</a>.

I think one of the big problems, though, is that my natural tendency is to try to prove and validate myself. I've learned that, when it comes to my job, I'm still seeking to be good enough, to be the best, to be the one person who changes the world (and anything less is worthless). My identity isn't really found in Him - not quite all of the time, anyways. Before I had this job, I knew that people would turn to their careers and paychecks for identity - but I never really knew the struggle until I gained those things and felt the extreme insecurity of them. I wake up and go to work feeling like everything could come crashing down if I don't produce and out-work all of my coworkers. Suzi can attest to my increased crankiness and stress levels since starting at Amazon. There's a prevalent paradigm of proving yourself - and the fear you'll be cut once they figure out you don't really know what you're doing.

I guess I'm struggling to learn how to work at work. I'd appreciate prayer and advice.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>I finally watched Dark Knight</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I admit that I'm not very good at watching movies. I watched Gladiator for the first time just a few months ago. I still haven't seen Braveheart and the only Star Wars I watched was #3. (Though I did see Inception 3 times in theaters.) Today, I finally got around to watching the Dark Knight (and yes, I didn't even pay attention to Batman Begins, but at least I sorta watched it). But yes - wow! How I wish I had seen it 4 years ago when it came out so I could partake in the morality conversations that must have been sparked afterwards!

Since everyone and their mom has seen the Dark Knight, I won't spend time summarizing what happened in the movie.

I honestly identified with the Joker in this movie - maybe even more with Batman. I was also tense the whole movie and was mad that no one would just kill the Joker or Harvey Dent, even if it was preemptive (in my mind, that would have solved everything! Why didn't Batman just kill them? I don't know if this is Biblical, as David also refused to kill Saul or his eldest son Absalom, even though they were trying to kill him).

The Joker said that who a person really was could be found in the moments before their death. And while I don't think that we should be initiating anyone's death, I think we really do have a hard time knowing who we are because we let so many different things move and define us. We build our lives on our accomplishments and our positions in life and we find identity and value in these things.

There was the juxtaposition and tension of two views on human nature - one is innately evil and the other innately good. The Joker believed that everyone is, at the core, uncivil and maniacal and self-obsessed - he sought to expose just how selfish and cowardly and incapable they really are. They all trusted in their money (hence, the Joker burned his half of the money) or their plans (be it for safety or prosperity). So the Joker wanted to disrupt the entire system so that nobody could continue living in their convoluted worlds and pursuing their own gains (whether by ill or noble means).

I find this strangely consistent with my view on human nature - though I find it entirely necessary to state the difference in our paradigms. The Joker believed that people were evil and that the result of this should be to turn to chaos, as this would be a more proper reflection of life: there would be nothing but chaos if people actually and unreservedly did whatever they wanted, without reservation. In a sense, his "gospel" was to be selflessly, carelessly destructive, because there was ultimately nothing worth fighting for. The Joker didn't care if he died. He didn't care if he beat Batman. He simply wanted to incite chaos in Gotham. In a sense - the Joker wanted to save the people from their own pointless disillusionment. He saved them from something, but he saved them to chaos.

As for me - I'm all for the revelation of human insufficiency and selfishness. Watching the Dark Knight helped me, at least a little bit, to recognize my own inability and need to be saved from myself - if I'm not saved from myself, I could easily turn into a Harvey Two Face, driven by anger and resentment and failing to realize that I've become the person that I hate, the hero who lived long enough to see himself become the villain. I agree with our need to be humbled and freed, but the distinction in my opinion is that we are not freed into chaos were everyone is just as messed up as anyone else. I think we can be saved to something greater - there is redemption to be found in Christ (or, to stick with the movie parallel, Batman - who is the superhero we don't deserve and yet need, and yet still condemn and despise).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the past year and a half, a lot of doors have opened and closed. I finished school at OU, college ministry with CRU, life in Oklahoma, working at K20, and living with some great friends. I picked up a new chapter in September in San Francisco and was soon off to another one in Seattle. Since I've gotten to Seattle, my life has been a lot of work and church, and it's been a thrill to see an intersection between the two (seeing church intersect into work, not the other way around).

For Suzi, her life is changing rather rapidly as well. She's closing out four years in college and five hot and humid years in Oklahoma. Now, fearlessly, she's about to enter into a new chapter in Seattle, welcoming new challenges, friends, lifestyle, and weather. I think that's what makes me the most nervous about marriage. I feel like I have a lot of confidence in Suzi and her character and commitment, knowing that she is "being renewed in knowledge after the image of her Creator" (Col 3). I have confidence that she'll love and respect me, more out of obedience to God than desire for me. But as for new circumstances, the unforeseen issues we'll face, the adjustments to intimacy and proximity... I know we don't have a choice but to persevere... but I'm nervous as to how it will all develop. Maybe the hard thing about relationships is that they're not without cost and struggle.

Some people ask if I get nervous about getting married, but I feel like I have a lot of confidence - in God to mature me and teach me to lead and in Suzi to love me and submit to me. I am, though, getting a little nervous about the new circumstances and what they will mean for Suzi and me, simply because I have no idea what to expect and the issues that we'll face.

I've come to realize that much of my identity in Seattle (and in general) has revolved around me being engaged (second to my identity in Christ). Rightly so - at the most foundational level, my association with her will trump my association with almost anything else. My church fellowship has been eagerly waiting to meet Suzi since the engagement in February, and so we've had a good 6 months to talk about her and what she's like and how wedding planning has developed. (Everyone gets a good laugh from learning that we met at the gym, envisioning over-the-top pick-up lines that were about the exact opposite of what actually happened.)

Church won't quite be the same as it was for the last 8 months. Work won't be the same. Home won't be the same. I won't get to do everything that I grew accustomed to doing and some of the changes will just seem really weird and I'll want to resist. But I'm certain things will still be better, knowing that "better" and "happier" or "better" and "more comfortable" are sometimes antonyms.

It's helplessly frightening to know that I'm not supposed to keep secrets from Suzi and to be forced to consider my shortcomings and mistakes and the direct impact they will have on her life. I shudder at the thought of the fights we'll have and how painfully aware I'll be of my sin, the things I'm capable of when I have a bad day or simply when I'm tired or haven't eaten. But how restoring and reaffirming it is to be loved, independent of my action or ability or potential value to Suzi. How much more significant it is to come face to face with myself and my sinfulness - not how capable I am, but how helpless. Not how loving I am, but how selfish. I'll no longer have to think of humility in an abstract manner... but in fact, it will be all too real.

There are definitely things that I will remember fondly from these past 8 months in Seattle despite being separated from Suzi. There was the community we developed at church, on top of late night Friday fellowships (thanks to Lisa and Lauren's tireless cooking) and Saturday night get-togethers (of herb burgers, birthday celebrations, and Catan). It was the small activities that made a big difference for me, as an outsider being invited into something bigger. There were things as trivial as sitting through the UW graduation, helping out in the puppet show at VBS, and passing out goldfish in the International District street fair. I'll remember those first critical weeks playing ping pong with Chris on Ruby 5 and spending the night (and the only time Bean jumped on me when I was asleep) because home didn't yet feel like home. I'll remember the climbing sessions with Fred, eating a baby-sized burrito at Gordito's, a late night talk at Pike Place and the first hangout at Sushiland, and, of course, the night he proposed to Julia at Gordon's show. And, of course, the 12 egg omelette we ate at Beth's Cafe. And Lisa and Jonie's perfect game. And the day we'll get our pictures on the wall at Burger Madness... (that hasn't happened yet, but it will). I could go on. There was the time I had Ivan's cooking, all of the times Tammy drove me back home, the time James went blind nil at Pastor Matt's house, and the time we locked ourselves out of Pastor Matt's house using floss.

Out of everything, there were still bigger things than just having friends and good times. It helped to see Christians who took Christ seriously and really believed in what He said - that we will lose our lives if we try to save them and that we can't identify with the world and that persecution is a sign of a healthy walk. It helped to see people who believed in God even though they weren't raised in Christian homes. We talked about a lot of things. I learned that I didn't have much of an excuse for not giving my money to church or to people in need. I learned that relationships with non-Christians don't make much sense if they never produce presentations of the gospel. I learned that we should always be spontaneously talking about God, out of genuine desire and joy - and I saw us begin to actually do it. We talked about philosophy, dinosaurs, sex, predestination, the validity of the Bible, abortion, drinking, speaking in tongues, and then some.

I love the way things turned out. Last year, when I had changed my mind about marriage, I began wondering what kind of story, what kind of life I was going to invite my future wife into. I wondered how things would be different from when we dated - when we stalled spiritually and isolated ourselves from others. As we talked about community in a guy's group Bible study last night... I think that what has given me the most confidence is thinking that I am welcoming Suzi into this kind of community. I'm not inviting her to move 2000 miles away to spend all of her time in our condo, working a job, and enjoying each other's company in our free time. I'm inviting her into community, into an environment where I really feel like God is actively moving, into a church that welcomes and encourages and provides opportunities to serve Christ as a body.

I'm still nervous... but I'm just as confident, more confident than I thought I would be.

Countdown is 16 days. I'll be back in Tulsa this weekend.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back in Tulsa for the weekend for Aaron and Jennifer's wedding. Midway through the ceremony, I realized that it is important to go to weddings.

Weddings demonstrate a distinct end and beginning. The end of two individuals and the beginning of one couple, one covenant.

Weddings don't just happen. You don't just wake up one morning and get married like it's nothing. You work towards it, prepare your heart for it, weigh your priorities and desires, and ready your lifestyle to adjust. Even if you do none of those things, you at least book the venue, appoint your bridal party, prepare food, and invite people. It can't only be a spur of the moment decision, because it requires time to execute.

Why is this important? Because it signifies that we must be ready. At least for me, I've started to hate the idea of judgment. That's one of the reasons I'm scared of racing again - what if I'm not ready? What if I've gotten a lot slower since my faster days in high school? Fear of judgment is also one of the reasons I hate going to the dentist.

Our actions are not without consequence. We'd often like to think that we can do whatever we want and we won't have to be held accountable, and so we stop testing ourselves and checking that our actions align with what is right. It's easier to be apathetic, especially when right is inconvenient.

With that said - it's important to go to weddings. You realize that what you do isn't just whatever, isn't just what you choose to do with your life. But ultimately, you have to be ready to give an account for what you've done.

To the Christians in Corinth, Paul writes: "Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies" (6:19-20).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What I Wish I Knew In College</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[College was a time of great growth for me spiritually. Here are some things I wish I had known [boomer!] sooner!
<ul>
	<li>It is crucial that you get plugged in with community. While people can say that going to church doesn't make you a Christian (and it doesn't), a result of a healthy spiritual walk will mean you're going to be going to church, having community, and surrounding yourself with Godly people, because you understand that the people you hang out with will affect the person you become. The Christian walk literally cannot be done alone.</li>
	<li>Invest in one campus ministry. My freshman year, I thought I should just do everything and commit to everything, and there were so many campus ministries that I could do a different one every night. While that may sound impressive and zealous, it's simply not sustainable, and I'm doubtful it can yield real, deep relationships. Choose one and put all your eggs in that basket. That might make your decision on where to church easier, since campus ministries are often aligned or partnered with local churches.</li>
	<li>Churches and campus ministries aren't quite one-size-fits-all. People use the term church-hopping, which isn't quite right, because I don't think we should choose where to go to church based solely on what the church has to offer someone. At that point, it can get pretty selfish - I may only go to the church that serves me the most. It's a church, and we're all following God. I heard someone say that one campus ministry was "better" than another - and if both are truly Christ-seeking, this statement is alarmingly missing the point.</li>
	<li>At the end of my freshman year, I was faced with the decision to join leadership with one campus ministry or another. I went with one ministry and really struggled with connecting with the people there. I switched commitments to the second campus ministry a month or so in and I really thrived there (I spent the next 3 years there). Sometimes you connect with people and sometimes you don't. I'm not saying that things couldn't have worked at the first ministry, but I had a hard time feeling like I was a part of the body and that people were really investing in me. The experience has led me to think that one size doesn't quite fit all.</li>
	<li>Actions/fruit are indicative of your walk. People can really be convinced that they believe something, but their actions can be completely opposite, which should be a red flag. You either don't believe what you think you do or you are being alarmingly hypocritical. This was the case for me. I said I believed God, but there was a long time in which my actions simply did not align with that. It hurt my testimony to others and undoubtedly marred the name of God. If you know you're doing what you shouldn't be doing... something needs to change. I needed to be honest with what was going on inside of me with myself and other people that I knew I could trust.</li>
	<li>In ministry, don't be satisfied with someone telling you that they believe what you believe. I remember sitting across from a guy in the student union, trying to tell him about Jesus and Christianity, and him telling me that he basically believed everything I believed, though I knew from his lifestyle that he didn't. What I couldn't put my finger on was that he didn't have an idea of surrender and being crucified with Christ, which kinda traced back to mean he didn't really believe what I believed fundamentally.</li>
	<li>Consider yourself blessed if you offend people and they think you're weird (and persecute you, essentially). I wish I had spoken more harshly and directly with people. I was too sensitive and afraid of being offensive. When I think back about my reputation at OU, I still feel like I have a pretty good reputation. I have a lot of Facebook friends. But we were not meant to be friends with this world and we shouldn't desire it (for at that point, we are enemies of God). Being out of college and realizing that I no longer have contact with any of these people - I realize it wouldn't have been a big deal to lose some friends and reputation.</li>
	<li>Share the gospel with everyone. In CRU, there is a tendency to use the number of spiritual conversations as a metric for level of outreach. A year removed from college, I now think that spiritual conversations are "easy" - at least in my workplace, I haven't initiated with anyone who won't talk to me about spiritual things. But it is intensely difficult to effectively live and communicate the gospel.</li>
	<li>College presents more opportunities to grow spiritually than maybe any other time in your life. But as much as people walk away from God in college, people also walk away from God post-college, when there aren't people specifically pursuing you and keeping you accountable. Faith isn't a college commitment, but a life commitment, and people need to be saved not to a church or a campus ministry, but to God Himself, or they will likely miss the point and later walk away.</li>
</ul>
In closing - here are 3 points I hope you'll take out of this.
<ol>
	<li>Be in community - go to church and a campus ministry on a regular basis</li>
	<li>Don't be satisfied with mere "belief." Understand the necessity of obedience</li>
	<li>Share the gospel explicitly with everyone - you can probably spare to lose some "friends"</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>14 More Hours</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Maybe it's the deliriously ambitious state I'm in or the sobering realization that everything is about to happen, but I'm putting this post together through fatigue, stress, and joy.

First off - I'm blown away by the love and support of Suzi and my friends, who have come from the edges of the nation and worked tirelessly, even more so than myself. Their persistence and kindness is unparalleled by any other point in my life and I am intensely proud to say these are my friends and that, in a non-heretical way, I would really trust my life with them. I know their hearts and their continuous prayers and tangibly see their live by their service and encouragement. Many people worked for hours on small tasks which they hated, and even now as I type, there is a fleet of helpers working voluntarily, late into the night. And I must say - I'm tremendously impressed by such a high scale wedding that Suzi and her family can put together.

In many regards, I'm amazed and surprised by what they've come up with and can take no credit for what I am certain will be an amazing wedding, despite the chaos leading to that 30 minute ceremony and few hour reception.

It's great to see the intersection of many of my past communities, to see complete strangers get along and have a good time, despite such different backgrounds. I really am proud of my friends and I hope they know that. It's why I make it a point to praise them, though I hope that doesn't take anything from the glorification of God alone.

Additionally - I'm blown away by the people that've been assembled. My groomsmen are each awesome in what they do and represent crucial parts of my life. Our musicians practically have me singing down the aisle. As my mom warned, our flower girls will probably steal the show. Our officiant is a greatly gifted speaker that has seen Suzi and my relationship through its very lowest and highest. The people we gather with have seen both where we've come from and where we're going and know that it's nothing short of the work of God that we can finalize this marriage covenant. It is most certainly a celebration - not of Suzi or me, but of Christ Himself - and we pray it will be a sweet smelling aroma, a worship set of genuine praise.

I've had a great time meeting Suzi's family, playing with the kids, eating papaya salad, and preparing for the wedding together. It's been quite joyful and I am truly grateful to be welcomed into the family as I have been.

Finally, I look forward (and even in disbelief) to knowing that August 25th has finally come. While things have certainly been quite chaotic and stressful, and I am afraid I may not savor the moment as much as I can, I can't wait to be married, to be beautifully united to my wife in all things. I can't wait to hit the hotel suite and sleep for days. I can't wait to kiss her and to her I love her. I can't wait to move to Seattle, introduce her to my condo, and take her to all of the places I've been eagerly waiting to show her. And lastly, I can't wait to see what God does in and through and for and to us.

There is nothing greater than the love of Christ.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Things I Remember About Our Wedding</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people told us to enjoy our wedding day as much as we could and try to take it all in. This is a blog post to recount some of those things.
<ul>
	<li>I had a chance to say something at the reception - I thanked a few people, but wasn't able to eloquently communicate what Suzi and I were thinking. What I wish I had said is something like this - "Today is a celebration, for Suzi and me and our families. We thank you for coming to be a part of that. We want to leave no mistake, though, that <strong>this is not a celebration of us, but for us</strong>. The real celebration is not of our love or commitment or ability, as if we are two perfect people who will live happily ever due to self-sufficiency. It is a celebration of God's design of marriage to bring us into relationship with each other as He's brought us into relationship with Him, <strong>a celebration of God's relentless love</strong> to towards us and to enable us to be more like Him and to see how infinite His love must be if He can love people like us."</li>
	<li>Suzi and I remain floored at the amount of love, encouragement, and support we received from family and friends that weekend. Suzi's maid of honor, Kaley, even suggested that I had chosen my groomsmen and ushers based on their work ethic, because everyone worked long hours for the entire weekend - setting up, tearing down, folding napkins, folding paper to put cookies in, constructing programs, arranging the tables in the reception, carrying cinder blocks around, twisting purple streamers for literally hours. We had Moms cooking all weekend for the reception.</li>
	<li>We really thought we had the best supporting cast around us.</li>
	<li>I was proud to have my 6 groomsmen exactly who they were and from many different stages/walks of my life. There were people from my home church, my college church, from my new church in Seattle. I'm very much a product of their compassion and faithfulness.</li>
	<li>I was ecstatic for all of the ushers (who looked stunning, by the way) - good friends from the past few years. Suzi and I were psyched to have Mike Beckham officiate, as the director from the college ministry we had gotten plugged into at OU (http://oucru.com/). We were psyched to have Miles (http://mileswittboyer.blogspot.com/2012/08/tulsa-oklahoma-wedding-photography-suzi.html) as our photographer. We were psyched to have Ka and Meng do the drapery, Pang to figure out the details and roles of the ceremony, and Chue to emcee the reception. We were psyched to have Fred and Shoua do the music. We were blessed to have good weather and to have been able to do everything at Liberty Church, less than a mile from both of our houses</li>
	<li>I remember walking into the church for the first time on Thursday night and having absolutely no idea what it was going to look like. I walked into a giant gym with the basketball hoops still down and didn't know what people meant when they talked about setting up the "drapery" and a "piping system." I literally couldn't picture it.</li>
	<li>We went back to Suzi's that night and there was papaya salad. I had seconds. We folded a bunch of scrapbook paper to store the wedding favors - Suzi's mom's cookies that are known as far as California. Jonathan folded an octagon and so we did a handful of really nice ones for the bridal party. Suzi and I tried to finish the ceremony program, but we had some custom fonts, and it never occurred to me to save the file as a PDF</li>
	<li>Friday morning, Suzi and I rushed to get the programs printed. Something was wrong with Suzi's dress, but we didn't have time to take care of it. We needed to pick up some flowers, but they weren't what had been promised to Suzi and she pretended like it was okay, but she almost cried when she saw them. We rushed back to the church and helped with the drapery. There was some standing around. There were some miscellaneous errands that needed to be run.</li>
	<li>At one point, Chris and Jonathan and I got cinder blocks from Lowe's. Billy and I ran to Suzi's house and stuffed his SUV full of flowers to take back to the church. At some other point, Suzi got a pedicure (and didn't enjoy it). Her phone was dying. Suzi was mostly calm the whole night. A few of us helped Bas assemble a canopy, and everyone else sat in a room and twirled purple streamers for several hours. Lisa hated it. Hailey designed a banner with the text "I am my beloved's and he is mine" that would be walked down the aisle during the ceremony by 2 boys.</li>
	<li>The rehearsal was supposed to start at 7, but it really didn't start until 8. Fred flew in and Billy picked him up, and it was good to see him, since he had just moved to San Francisco for seminary. Cheezit drove in from Kansas, and a bunch of guys got in from Norman. Kaleb beat me in a race and I had to buy him a Snickers bar, but he thought I had promised him a new pair of sneakers. Napkins got folded. Fred and I drove to FedEx to pick up our programs, then we all sat in a big circle and compiled them. The drapery started coming together, and then everyone was putting on seat covers and setting up tables. People were telling me to leave, so I went home and slept</li>
	<li>Suzi got 4 hours of sleep. I got 7 or 8 hours of sleep, then tried to meet Mike Beckham at Chick-fil-a. We ordered from the lunch menu instead of the breakfast menu and it took way too long. I had to rush home and change into my suit in a frenzy, realizing that I had forgotten a solid white undershirt. I drove fast to get to the place we were taking pictures. I think I needed to be there by 11. I got there a few minutes late, and the other groomsmen poured in around 20 minutes later. Our appointment at the Tulsa Garden Center was supposed to start at 11:30, but I think the girls were running late and didn't get in until 12:20 or so. Suzi and I had said that we would get to see each other that day, but our photographer Miles arranged it so that we didn't get to see each other. Joey and Jonathan pushed me into a bathroom while the girls came in. I called Cheezit to see if he had any gum, and then I called my mom about plastic spoons.</li>
	<li>There had been a 40% chance of rain, which had been stressing Suzi out, and it was raining a little that morning. I had a few people say it would be good for the lighting in our pictures. Turns out that they were right! Rain wasn't a problem at all, to Suzi's relief.</li>
	<li>While we waited, we walked around the inside and took some pictures, since we looked pretty good. For the few days after the wedding, Suzi kept on going back to Miles' blog and saying that all of us looked like models. There was a room full of books, and we pulled out all of the big ones and took pictures, posing like we were reading them. There was a giant book about birds, I think, and some other book called "The Weeds of Nebraska." Jonathan pulled me aside a few times and told me to calm down, asking what he could do to make sure everything got done. Two older ladies complimented us on our ties as we waited in the lobby. The groomsmen and I sat in a big room while we waited for the girls to finish taking pictures. I remember talking about the Hunger Games, but don't remember much else. I was happy to see all of them get along well, as almost none of them had met previously. After waiting, they made me take a bunch of pictures with Suzi with my eyes closed. Then the girls headed back to the church while the guys took pictures. Joey jumped over me and then licked my face. I drove back fast with Joey and we talked about my life and how everything had changed over the past few months.</li>
	<li>We got back to the church and there were a bunch of people already there (since we were starting in like 15 minutes). There was some running around as Billy didn't have the ring. I saw some people I knew and was happy. I accidentally saw Suzi in her dress, but I looked away before I could process anything. I went out to the lobby where my sister was attending the guestbook and accidentally saw pictures of Suzi in her dress, but then looked again as soon as I registered. We were playing Hillsong Chapel (an acoustic CD Hillsong put together) as background music. The ushers looked super sharp and I talked to Vincent for a little bit of time. I paced in an empty hallway for a little bit of time and prayed. A lot of people asked if I was nervous and I just said that I was happy, certain, and confident. I was all of those things - I was glad that the day had finally come. Then we were going.</li>
	<li>I walked my mom down the aisle with my dad following. I remember Fred starting to play and the curtains opening for Suzi's mom and Lou to go first. Then my mom and I started walking and it was like going down a runway. The center aisle was covered with rose petals. There were a ton of people taking pictures, but I don't really remember any faces. I remember consciously trying to walk slowly, and smiling a lot, and whispering something to my mom about how we were walking. Then I went to a backroom, walked out again with Mike and the groomsmen, and watched the bridesmaids walk down the aisle. I looked around and saw that people were lining the walls in the back... and we had some 350 chairs already set out. Fred and Shoua were singing No One Loves Me Like You from Jars of Clay. I put my hand on my heart so that I could feel my heartbeat racing (that gesture also just makes me feel stiller).</li>
	<li>Fred switched to play Your Love is Strong by Jon Foreman and there was a pause before Kaleb and Ezra came out with the banner Hailey had designed, reading "I am my beloved's and he is mine". I was confused because I thought it was supposed to be Aiden and Ezra. I guess I had no idea what was going on behind the curtains. Then Autumn and Aiden came out as the flower girl and ringbearer. Aiden must have been a little nervous, because he was pushing Autumn almost to the side of the aisle. Autumn tried to center them back. Keisha, another flower girl, didn't walk. There were a ton of people. It was crazy. No way I could've done that as a child.</li>
	<li>Then Suzi walked down with her dad. I guess I smiled really big and thought of the symbolism of her dad handing her off to me and how beautiful Suzi looked. I was happy that everyone's eyes were placed on Suzi and that everyone got to behold her beauty. I liked her dress.</li>
	<li>Mike started in prayer and then started. Suzi and I were facing him, positioned in a triangle. I remember him saying that I had a good job, but that shouldn't factor into how much Suzi loves me. I actually don't remember that much else. When we got to the vows, both Suzi and I had trouble repeating what Mike had said. Suzi put a ring on me and it was a little big. The first thing we did, instead of a unity candle, was a footwashing.</li>
	<li>Fred was playing "In Christ Alone" while Suzi was seated and I knelt to wash her feet. It made a lot more sense doing it with water than without, as we had done during the rehearsal. Washing Suzi's feet made a lot of sense. I thought about washing her with water by the word, as that popular Ephesians 5 passage says.</li>
	<li>We had written each other letters and we read them to each other. I went second. I had structured my letter into 2 parts, explaining that I was so excited because of the man I was standing before her and because of the woman standing before me. Suzi didn't cry. I didn't cry. Apparently a lot of other people cried though. I think it was easy for us to be more joyous and relieved that all of this was finally happening.</li>
	<li>Our first kiss was unusually super awkward. It was so awkward. I hesitated because I almost didn't know what to do. Kissing suddenly felt really weird. We had kissed before, but we hadn't done it for nearly a year. After Mike told me to kiss my bride, we both paused and just stood there, then Suzi gave me a really quick peck. Just in case anyone's wondering, we now kiss on a regular basis.</li>
	<li>We were pronounced man and wife and we stepped to the edge of the stairs. Fred and Shoua began playing Divine Romance, starting at the chorus, and we started walking back down the aisle as applause ensued. We stopped to hug our parents and I remember Suzi's mom giving me a big hug and telling me to take care of her. I said I would. If I remember correctly, I told my mom that I loved her when I hugged her.</li>
	<li>We walked back into a waiting room and were ecstatic as the groomsmen/bridesmaids re-joined us. We hung out a little and then went back to the chapel to take family pictures with our photographer Miles. Miles then took us outside of the church and got a few more pictures of the bridal party, then took some pictures of just Suzi and me. I liked it, more or less. I'm not used to being the center of attention in pictures, so it's nice to get a few.</li>
	<li>We went back inside the church to the reception, where people had been eating fruit and most people were seated. Unfortunately, when we walked in, I heard dubstep playing. My wedding playlist was incomplete - it only had like 5 or 6 songs, and so Spotify played a bunch of my other songs, which were unfortunately dubstep. I remember finding Vincent and telling him to get the music changed. Later, Cheezit and Jojo found a bunch of other songs to play, including One Direction.</li>
	<li>Suzi and I got seated on a platform at the front, behind our bridal party. Chue emceed, first letting Suzi and me say something, then Suzi's dad, then my uncle Jimmy in place of my dad, then Suzi's uncle from Illinois. Then toasts from Kaley and Billy! Kaley mentioned how we had first met and how she said that she would drop kick me if I broke Suzi's heart. She said she no longer held those feelings, though I had a handful of people come up afterwards and say that they would, indeed, dropkick me. I enjoyed Billy's toast and he encouraged us to stay in community and to love the Lord our God with all of our hearts and minds and souls. Then we were eating. But we didn't really eat that much. People started coming up and there was an endless stream of photo-taking. It was pretty crazy.</li>
	<li>Suzi and I went back to the Tulsa Garden Center with Miles to grab a few more pictures before the sunset. There was good natural lighting.</li>
	<li>We eventually left and I drove Suzi to her place to get ready. I went back home to drop off the Camry and pick up the other car, but the other car wasn't there. There were some kind of complications. Chris and Lisa were there, loading a bunch of books into the trunk of the Camry, then going back to haul cinder blocks back to my house for my mom. Suzi and I ended back at the church to get Suzi's chapel. We ended up staying for a while and socializing a little. Then we ended up at the Campbell Hotel for the next few days.</li>
	<li>We didn't quite stay at the hotel though. The next morning, we drove back near our houses to have Jimmy's Egg for breakfast. Strangely, Ruth and Matt and some of their friends were also there. Then we hung out with some of Suzi's family as the kids swam. We ended up back at Suzi's house and Autumn gave me her dessert drink. We had Oklahoma Joe's barbecue for lunch and it was really good. I played some card games with her cousins and then Suzi and I had a formal goodbye from her parents. They gave us advice and there were a bunch of tears. There's nothing like watching your wife's parents really "give" her to you and entrust her to your care, to acknowledge that after 22 years of watching after your daughter, you were trusting some guy to love her as you love her.</li>
	<li>We ran a bunch of random errands, like returning some rental chairs and tablecloths. We returned some things and packed and took naps. We went to the Tulsa Aquarium (as Suzi had never been and it was somewhat of a goodbye to Tulsa) and played a video game that allowed us to feed the sharks (well, the video game sharks). And we fed shrimp to manta rays.</li>
	<li>The day we left for Seattle was pretty stressful, and I accidentally thought our flight was an hour earlier than it really was. We got stopped at security for Suzi's unopened Hello Kitty ice cream maker. We went from TUL to DEN and ate at a place called "It's a Wrap! It's a bowl!" Then we were in Seattle, getting picked up by my pastor and his wife, Matt and Lauren. We grabbed some Chipotle and went back to eat at their place, where Jimmy and Lois and Tiffany were. Then we got a ride to Chris's house, where we drove his car back home to Redmond (also, getting lost in the process :/).</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Prior to the wedding, many brides before me warned that the day would just fly by. I think the fear of not remembering my wedding day made me more aware of living in the moment. I wanted to see what was happening around me and realize what it all meant. I also wanted to remember the process of wedding planning also. I hope it will give men insight of what the woman is going through, and women/soon-to-be brides some tips on what to expect.


Planning:

---I would say the hardest part about planning is trying to meet everybody's expectation of what your wedding should be like. You want to please everybody. You want your mom's approval- especially with the wedding dress because it's also a mother-daughter experience. You want your mother-in-law's approval because you want to start the relationship off right- don't want to step on any landmines too early. You want your maid of honor's approval because she's your only voice of reason when everything around you is feeling like the world is out of control. In times of tension, I remembered feeling that if my maid of honor was good with my decisions, then everything else was good. Now I know why the wedding industry always says, "It's whatever the bride wants." I think in the media, that phrase gives the bride permission to be bridezilla, but really, sometimes it was a relieve to hear those words because a lot of times, I was being pulled in so many directions by so many people.

---This point is almost along the same lines, but the most frustrating part of planning was being the middle-man. In a wedding, there are so many people involved that it's hard getting everybody on the same page. I remember the process of answering one person's question was dependent on another person's answer, and that person probably didn't respond for a long time. For example, when contacting the salon to set up a hair and makeup appointment for the wedding day, I had to email my photographer about the wedding schedule, and apparently all the emails to my photographer went to his junk mail so he didn't reply until 2-3 weeks later. Although this wasn't something my photographer was aware of, it made me anxious. When I had to set up a time to take engagement pictures, I couldn't pick a date or location until David bought his plane ticket. I couldn't pick a location on the wedding day until the locations answered my calls. I remember it took Philbrook Museum didn't call me back until a week later. I just wanted to get things done, but sometimes I had to wait. The waiting process became annoying because all the while, there are other people asking you questions that you can't answer. I think it was in these moments where declared that I officially wanted to give up on wedding planning.

---I wanted my wedding to be a DIY wedding. I loved handmade weddings. I loved writing down the list of things I wanted to make. I did find great joy in being able to sit down for hours at a time and just create. I was an escape for me. The only thing I wish I would have known was that my vision for the wedding was going to change as I continued to plan. As things started to come together, sometimes I realized my old ideas no longer worked or I had an even better idea. Sadly, I made the mistake of buying my supplies in advance and later changed my mind. I couldn't return them because it was already over 30 days of purchase (Hobby Lobby has a 30 day policy). So I ended up with over $300 worth of arts and crafts supplies that I never used.

---I think it was really helpful for me to make a list of the things I cared about purchasing and the things that I could care less for. It made me focus on the things that did and didn't matter when things got consuming. For example, the big things for me were photography, ceremony and reception decorations. The things that I didn't care much for/ wasn't going to spend countless hours on were stationary, fonts, transportation (like renting a limo), the rehearsal dinner food, and the music (I trusted David with it). Knowing these things saved a lot of time!

---Planning was really hard while I was in school! I did half the planning during my last semester at OU. It was pretty bad because I had an intense group project I had to commit to at any time of day, but I also had to go home every weekend to find a venue! It definitely caused a lot of stress. Most of the stress came from letting down my group members though. After I found a venue, I just committed to school because I wanted to finish strong.  I believe I didn't do any wedding planning for a month and a half.

---I think it's important thing was to be flexible. Don't have a set image of what your wedding will look like because it will change. This could also trigger bridezilla mode.

---Lastly, the most important thing I believe brides-to-be should keep fresh in their minds, is the fact that at the end of the day, you're going to married. It doesn't matter if everything is out of place, or if the venue burns down. The only thing that has to go right, is getting married! It wouldn't be a wedding if the groom wasn't there!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friday before the wedding:

This was the day I had to get it all done. The pressure was so intense. If only someone warned me about the day before the wedding! As a bride, YOU WILL GET NOTHING DONE! All the productivity comes from the people helping out with the wedding! The day will be filled with running errands and trying to remember things you can never remember.

In the morning around 9am, I called David to come over so we would finish the programs and get them printed at Kinkos. David was still asleep when I called and I told him that if he didn't come over in 15 minutes, I was going to find something else that needed to be done (probably to pick up my flowers from the flower shop). Surprisingly, David came very promptly. We worked on the programs for an hour because we couldn't figure out the wording and we had no clue how to format. Our wedding etiquette was pretty terrible.

By 10am, we went to FexEx Kinkos, and the lady at the desk helped us with our programs. We wanted 5x7 programs because I made envelopes for a 5x7 card. I was expecting everything to be around $300, but when the lady rung up the total, she said it was going to be $700! I almost fainted. The reason was because a 5x7 size card could only be printed once on each sheet of cardstock. Her solution was to make the size smaller so it could be printed twice on one sheet. We did that option and the total was about $400. If only I would have done them earlier, it would have been cheaper but a lot of the information I needed for the programs was dependent of other people's answers.

Afterwards, David and I had to go to the flower shop to pick up some stock that I ordered. Originally, I wanted some beautiful cream colored stock flowers with purple tips. It would have been so nice with my garden themed wedding. Sadly they were out of stock online and I went to the flower shop a week prior to the wedding to see if they could help me out. The lady said they could definitely help me. She did warn me that having cream with lavender tips might be hard to be exact because of mother nature, but worst case scenario, they would be lavender. I said it was fine because lavender was still a light color. BUT, when we went to pick up the flowers, they were NOT lavender! They were a dark purple! I did my best to not cry when I saw them because it totally threw off my theme! It was no longer going to be light and airy, but harsh. The lady asked if I liked them, and I said it was not what I expected. I'm sure she saw the disappointment on my face. David did a really good job of calming me. I think he understood the stress I was going through and did everything he could to not make it worse. He kept assuring me that everything would be okay. Looking back, it seemed kind of silly that I would cry over flowers, but I think it had more to do with me being stressed, the lack of sleep, and the pressure to exceed expectations than the flowers themselves.

After that, David and I went back to the church to decorate. Everyone was already there since 10am and my parents would soon bring everyone lunch around noon-ish. I had my friend Hailey in charge of a banner I was going to make- it was a DIY project that I could not complete in time. I took her to Michaels to buy her some supplies and we also met up with my cousins Bas and Kaley to buy last minute things. I told Kaley (who was also my maid-of-honor) about my flower situation, and she said I could buy floral paint to spray on the flowers. I had no idea those things existed! I was excited there was an option to still save my flowers. I bought the floral paint, but sadly, the lady doing my flower arrangements did not use the paint. It got to the point where I was so tired of making decisions about the details that I just started handing people $100 bills to buy stuff for me and when they asked about my opinion, I just said, "it's whatever." I just didn't care anymore, I was mentally and emotionally drained.

When I look back, I am so glad we had Liberty Church as our venue. It was right across the street from my house. If only I counted how many times I drove from my house to the church! I'm also extremely glad that I lived really close to all the craft stores! There was always a list going through my mind of what I needed to do and what I forgot from my house. It was only around 2pm and my phone only had 30-20% battery life left. I tried to write down all the things I still needed to do, but once I started writing down something, I would stop halfway and try to remember something else. I would try so hard to remember that "something else" that I forgot what I was writing down before I was distracted! I was just a mess. So frustrating.

Next, I had to run to walmart. Bas had an idea for the ceremony decor. I still had no idea what I wanted to do with the ceremony. As Bas was shopping, I was waiting in the car. I was kinda restless because I still had to pick up my rentals downtown which was a 20-30 minute drive and they would be closed in an hour. Finally, we got our stuff from Walmart, headed back to the church, and Kaley and I went downtown to get my rentals. After I got my rentals, I took the long way home. Kaley and I had some one-on-one time and she calmed me down when I vented my frustration. My brother bought the wrong size suit and he also did it last minute. One of my bridesmaids didn't have a dress until the very last minute also. Plus, she was going to be late for the dress rehearsal. The stress was just adding. My maid-of-honor was seriously the best maid-of-honor I could have. She made the process so much easier. She always thought ahead and was literally 3 steps ahead of me. As we continued driving in the car, she was calling stores around the area to find a suit for my brother. She took the time to take him suit shopping right after dress rehearsal.

When we got back to the church to drop off the rentals, I stopped by my place to grab a few things I remembered (thank God!), plus my charger. By this time, it was around 5pm and dress rehearsal was at 6pm. Kaley wanted me to relax so she took me to get a pedicure and manicure. As I was sitting in the parking lot waiting for Kaley to make an appointment, I realized that I totally forgot to tell my other flower girl's parents that dress rehearsal was in an hour! The only number I had was the flower girl's mother, but she didn't text me back because she was in class.

Now, I've never had a pedicure before...but I quickly concluded that I hated it! I didn't shave my legs for over a month and I was planning on shaving them that night. I was so embarrassed when the lady was rubbing lotion all over my legs! They probably thought I was an ugly bride that never shaved! I kept tensing up my toes because the hate the feeling of something poking beneath my toe nails! I couldn't relax. The lady kept telling me to stop tensing my toes and all I could say was, "I'm sorry!" I also have a tendency to repeat the phrase, "This is just a moment in time" whenever I'm in a situation I don't want to be in because it calms me to realize that my "suffering" is short compared to eternity. I was so glad when it was over. Although I do like the feeling of having clean feet, I probably will never have another pedicure.

When I got back to the church, it was around 6:30pm. Rehearsal wasnt even close to starting yet. Things were starting to come together, the ceremony looked great and the reception was coming along. I talked with a few people and asked my bridesmaids what they thought of my flowers because they looked nothing like I expected them to look. They all told me they looked good and I trusted their judgement. The reality was, everything DID look good. I just had to stop expecting my wedding to look like the weddings on Pinterest and all the wedding blogs I've been admiring for the past 6 months. My wedding wasn't going to look like a copied image on a screen, it was going to look like something I could call my own. I had to get over this thought that my wedding could only be "perfect" if it looked a certain way. When I look back, I can say that I loved my wedding because everything was a stamp of everyone's hard work. I see the evidence of a person's personal touch, I see the evidence of community.

By the time rehearsal started, my mom realized the my other flower girl Keisha wasn't there. She asked me if I told her family knew rehearsal was today and I told her that I forgot. My mom reacted like she was mad and yelled at me for being irresponsible. I felt kinda bad, but at the same time, I knew that my mom liked to overreact and then act completely fine a few minutes later.

As I was waiting for rehearsal to start, I sat in the front row watching people decorate the stage. Mary sat next to me and what she said to me made me teary-eyed. She told me to take a look at everything around me-everything was for me. This was MY wedding. I think all the errands earlier in the day made me lose sight of the fact that I was preparing for my wedding. It started to hit me that I was getting married! I looked at all the people who have spent hours making my wedding possible. It was amazing to realize that everybody sacrificed their entire day for David and me, not because they felt forced to, but because they cared. People could have easily stopped working and left, or just stood around socializing, but nobody abandoned their duties when they were needed.

At last, dress rehearsal was starting. I soon realized that I forgot to give Fred (our musician) the order of the set. I felt bad, it was another thing I failed to accomplish on my to-do list. We were given a few minutes to tell him the order and we all got into our places. I had no idea what to expect from the music, the ceremony lighting, or the bridesmaids/groomsmen order. I had all my bridesmaids wear different colored dresses, so I was pretty nervous how that was going to turn out. Finally my flower girl Keisha came right on time. As we all lined up in the hall, the little boys couldn't stand still. They had so much energy. I think at one point, we couldn't keep track of all boys at the same time-someone always ran off. The boys were also getting restless and tired, they didn't want to hold the banner or walk down. I asked my dad if he knew what to say when he handed me off and he couldn't say the phrase, "Her mother and I" properly. I think he kept on wanting to say, "Me and her mother."

As the music began, and I saw everyone walk down, it started to hit me again that I was getting married. I listened to they lyrics of the songs we chose to use for the ceremony and in that moment, I just worshiped. I got teary-eyed again and my heart raced. This was really happening.

When it was time for me and my dad to walk down the aisle, I couldn't look at David in the eyes. It wasn't because it was emotional, but I just felt weird! At the end of the aisle, our officiant (Mike Beckham) asked my dad who was giving me away to David. My dad forgot what to say and just said a jumble of words. It was pretty funny. Everybody laughed because it was kinda cute. When David came to take my hand, he didn't know what to do and attempted to give me and my dad an awkward hug/handshake. Again, everybody laughed. Good thing we had a rehearsal! After the rehearsal, we did it one more time and my mom prepared some food for us to eat. David and I thanked everybody for coming and helping.

The night was long from over. David and his best man, Billy, went to Kinkos and picked up the programs, Kaley took my brother to buy a suit, and I have no idea what I was doing at this time. Seriously, I can't remember! After Kaley found a suit for my brother, we went to Target to buy some glue sticks for the programs. I told my ushers how to assemble the programs. I remember telling my bridesmaids we were going to go to the hotel because I knew some of they were tired, but I got distracted from telling my ushers how to glue the programs. I don't think we went to the hotel until 10:30pm. As I was having a pretty fun time talking to everyone, Kaley and David had a plan to get me to the hotel so I could sleep. We were all sitting in a circle and David started to kiss my hand. I was really confused- it was so random. He asked if we could take a walk. When we got outside, Kaley followed. David said he needed to get his suit out of Kaley's car. Then he just opened the passenger door and made me get in. I still had no idea what was happening. When they told me I had to call it a night and sleep, I was confused why I had to! There was still so much to do.

Once at the hotel, I got ready to sleep, but couldn't. I still had to write a letter for David for the ceremony. I had an idea of what I wanted to say, but when I actually wrote it down, it was pretty cheesy. I also kept remembering things I forgot to buy/bring/do. I forgot baby wipes for the fingerprint guest book, I forgot to put questions on my sketchbooks for guests to sign, I made some wreaths for me and David's chair for the reception that needed to be tied on (they never made it, I don't know where they are to this day), I also forgot about the rock candy and paper straws that were behind the sofa in my house. I constantly texted Kaley these things, I'm sure she was pretty stressed out too. I was also constantly texting Ka (my cousin/wedding coordinator) a list of things I forgot also, like spraying the flowers with water, putting the favors on top of the napkins, where to put spoons and forks, how to decorate my cake table, what time the baby sitters should arrive. I could not relax my mind! Plus, I was still writing David's letter. I don't think I slept until 2 in the morning. I remember that when I finally decided to sleep, I still didn't finish the letter. Also, Kaley and I had to wake up at 7am to get the bouquets.

Friday night was hectic. I don't know how I made it. Although it was rough, one thing was exceptionally memorable. Throughout the day, people would pull me aside and tell me that David really loved me. They saw it from the way he cared for me and interacted with me. I'm glad that when I married him, I was confident in his love for me. I don't rest in the fact that David will love me perfectly. I'm glad our decision to marry was made with a clear mind. It hinged on the love of Christ- not "lovey dovey" emotion or superficial expectations to feel "completed." I'm glad to say that I woke up the next morning in complete confidence in my decision to marry David and commit to him for the rest of my life.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I haven't blogged about life in marriage since the wedding, partly because there's been so much to say and so much going on, and partly because I wanted to be able to write objectively about everything.

Suzi and I are back in Tulsa for the first time since the wedding, spending time with our families for Christmas, and planning to fly back to Seattle tomorrow. There's been a lot of ambivalence and adjustment with being back. Home doesn't quite feel like home, after Suzi and I have staked our home in Seattle and a handful of friends have moved away... I've also stayed a few nights at Suzi's place and am more or less abiding by their way of doing things, which is much more family oriented than I've been familiar with.

From hanging out with many of Suzi's friends and being asked how marriage has been, I've been processing how things have been going. I remember Jimmy saying once in our marriage group that one thing he really wanted for his marriage was transparency - not to be falsely joyful in the midst of conflict. Here are some of my thoughts:
<ul>
	<li>Fellowship is imperative. I had been blessed to get plugged into a church in Seattle within my first few months there, a church that I think is well grounded and in which I can sense growth and authenticity. I can't quite verbalize how big of a difference I think it has made for us to be able to have genuine friends in these critical first few months, to be able to lean on others for counsel and truth and balance. I fondly remember Korean barbecue at Jimmy's, Suzi winning her first Seven Wonders game, Bananagrams at Tim and Tina's, the many people (and Evie, Chris's relentlessly optimistic Pomeranian) pursuing Suzi, and even that amazing deal at Ezell's Chicken.</li>
	<li>Dating isn't like marriage. In some sense, that sounds like a no-brainer, but I think it's really not like marriage. I wouldn't encourage anyone to be in a dating relationship longer than a year or two, because I think the person you date is still significantly different from the person you marry (at least, in that, marriage is such a monumental event that it inevitably changes the people involved). As much as I thought dating would give me a glimpse of how Suzi would live in marriage, there are certainly things that marriage ushered in that I couldn't have known beforehand</li>
	<li>Suzi and I have communication issues. We fight more than I thought we would (though I indeed disengage about as much as I feared I would), and I remember Billy telling us that conflict wasn't a bad thing in his best man speech. In some ways, I really do think that our differences have become more pronounced, in terms of our eating and spending habits, our love languages, and the way we act when we get tired.</li>
	<li>Suzi and I fight about driving - it's one of our main fighting points. Apparently it's normal. I guess that brings me to the next point:</li>
	<li>Marriage is humbling. Not so much in the happy sense, like "this is awesome - I'm being sanctified!" but more in the "Arg, I don't feel like I can do anything right" kind of way. I've experienced this, at least, in the context of driving (and in the context of trying to make a pizza). I realize that I am pretty awkward and prone to walk away from people mid-conversation (sorry Teeko) and that I can be hilariously misinformed about some pretty obvious things. In terms of character traits, I'm often quick to speak or to shut down and quick to anger and would rather go to sleep than stay awake and try to understand how Suzi is feeling emotionally.</li>
	<li>Suzi and I are different. I didn't know that Suzi has gangster-type mannerisms or that she randomly breaks into foreign accents. Or that she doesn't use napkins very much. And she doesn't exactly desire cuddling.</li>
	<li>Suzi and I can push each other towards God in a unique way, in knowing each other intimately and knowing how we spend our time/knowing that we need to consecrate the time we spend together. It does happen, though we've only had a few sustained glimpses of it. We've had some good conversations and have gone through a few books together (Nehemiah, 2 Corinthians, Ezra, Hosea). I am among a community that is constantly challenging me to be a spiritual leader and to look after/challenge Suzi spiritually, as it is my Biblical role to return her back to Christ holy and blameless.</li>
	<li>I've learned a lot from Suzi and our church. I realize that it's not sin to be rich, but to stay rich, and that God's will is ultimately, simply obedience. I realize a certain level of conflict is good for a marriage. The implications of salvation are intensely, impossibly difficult, and many are deceived to think they have tasted it (in the past or in the current). I sometimes compliment others to try to manipulatively earn their favor (because I find an element of my value in their favor). I've been challenged in terms of fighting for justice for the oppressed and in terms of how I spend my money and time and how I work at work. I'm slowly learning what it means to love Christ with my heart, soul, strength, and mind, and to work a job wholeheartedly as to the Lord, even during the times that I don't enjoy it, and to sacrificially love and serve Suzi during the times I feel disrespected or wronged.</li>
</ul>
One moment that I've held onto took place one night during our first month together. We were about to go to sleep when I accidentally said something I shouldn't have said. Suzi was frustrated and went downstairs while I turned away and fell asleep... when I woke up the next morning to go to work, Suzi had spent the night making me a lunch.

I have to say... if I didn't believe that marriage was a picture of the love Christ has for the church, I would be terrified of marriage, because Suzi and I are so different and can be so selfish. Only because I know we are both commanded by God to abound in grace and mercy and love towards one another am I able to be so confident.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This site was put together a few months ago, but has been mostly neglected since. There were a few things I just couldn't motivate myself to do, like add pagination anywhere or change titles to links. Even getting Google analytics integrated took a long while. I was reading a random article on HackerNews about how a site had achieved 0.5ms load time, and thought that I had known most of the tricks. I thought, just for fun, I should see how fast davidandsuzi.com was loading - and it turns out that it wasn't fast at all. I was logging about 2.6 seconds for the first page load and 1.4 for the repeated view (after certain things had been cached). Seemed like it was time for an update.

I then found myself on a site (courtesy to HackerNews, again) about typography that was saying that the ideal number of characters per line was about 60. When I checked davidandsuzi.com, I was logging about 200... yeah.

So I spent this morning re-doing the site, adding pagination, compressing my JavaScript, and trying different Wordpress caching/minifying plugins. I got my characters per line down to 75 or so, increased my line-height, and made sure that I wasn't using #000 black anymore (because apparently actual black is uncool), but #333 black. I removed the photos and videos links from the top because they didn't make much sense. (I also tried to keep the header from sticking to the top of the window, since that didn't make sense either, but that didn't work for some reason.) But anyways, pagination was pretty important. I ended up putting only one post on the home page with a pagination link to the next post, instead of 5 with no pagination.

So now, my initial load time is down to 1.871 (for about a 28% decrease) and my repeated view time was down about 21%.

In the future, I'm hoping to:
<ul>
	<li>Add a cool sliding effect when you change blog post pages, like what Github does, using a History API</li>
	<li>Add some sidebar content, for popular/related posts, or biographical info for the David and Suzi pages</li>
	<li>Maybe use Jekyll to convert all of this to static files, and then serve it all through AWS CloudFront/S3 so I can get my latencies down even more</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my friends had an idea for a real-time RSS feed reader and he asked me to implement it. The specifications were this: it should
<ol>
	<li>accept an RSS feed (will cover)</li>
	<li>display items from that RSS feed in real time (will cover, partially)</li>
	<li>allow the user to set items to a "read" state (will cover)</li>
	<li>remember the user's "read" items</li>
	<li>have a mark and clear read items button (will cover)</li>
	<li>be able to toggle a light and dark theme (will cover)</li>
	<li>have a user login system</li>
</ol>
I hadn't worked with a real Javascript MV* framework or something like Yeoman or Grunt, so I wanted to take a few real technologies and use them correctly. I spent a day looking at Knockout and coding up a few examples before looking at AngularJS and realizing the code was a lot neater and more intuitive for me. Then, I started looking into Backbone and thinking that I would use it, then ultimately switching back to Angular because it seemed lighterweight and I thought what really mattered was the two-way data binding. (I was also going to shamelessly use Twitter Bootstrap for styles.)

As for a backend, I was somewhat set on using NodeJS instead of Ruby or Python since I have more JavaScript experience and have played around more in Node than Sinatra/Rails or Flask/Django.

In the end, I'm pretty impressed with AngularJS and ssee how much it has reduced my codebase, though I realize it doesn't fix every problem I have.
<h2>Accept an RSS feed</h2>
AngularJS basically allows you to bind data values to HTML elements. If I had the following HTML:
<pre>&lt;html ng-app&gt;
...
&lt;div ng-controller="RssFeedCtrl"&gt;

&lt;div class='container-fluid margin-top'&gt;
&lt;div class='span12'&gt;
&lt;form class="form-horizontal"&gt;
&lt;div class="control-group"&gt;
&lt;input id='rssFeed' ng-model='rssFeed' type="text" placeholder="RSS Feed"&gt;
&lt;button id='update' type="submit" class="btn" ng-click="updateModel()"&gt;Load feed&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
...
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
I would know that the input text-box #rssFeed will always be linked up to the variable located in $scope.rssFeed, as the ng-model attribute is set to rssFeed. So I can use this code:
<pre>function RssFeedCtrl($scope) {
	$scope.articles = [ ];
	$scope.rssFeed = 'http://hnapp.com/api/items/rss/a817dd49f3fe75b6fc2764bd98b714f7';
}</pre>
to automatically populate #rssFeed. If I were to change the value in that text box, then I could see that altered value in my javascript in $scope.rssFeed.

From the HTML, you'll also notice there's a button with an ng-click="updateModel()" attribute. So whenever the button is clicked, $scope.updateModel is called.
<h2>Display items from that RSS feed in real time</h2>
This code can then be used to populate $scope.articles:
<pre>//converts from RSS object to an object we're interested in
var parseEntry = function(el) {
	var date = el.publishedDate || el.pubDate;
	var content = el.content || el.description;
	return { title: el.title, content: content, read: false, date: date, link: el.link, shortLink: hostname(el.link) };
}

//parses an RSS feed using Google API
var parseRSS = function(url, callback) {
	$.ajax({
		url: '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/feed/load?v=1.0&amp;num=50&amp;callback=?&amp;q=' + encodeURIComponent(url),
		dataType: 'json',
		success: callback
	});
}

//called from button click
$scope.updateModel = function() {
	parseRSS($scope.rssFeed, function(data) {
		if(data == null)
			return;

		var mostRecentDate = null;
		if($scope.articles.length &amp;&amp; $scope.rssFeed == $scope.originalRssFeed)
			mostRecentDate = $scope.articles[0].date;

		var entries = _.map(data.responseData.feed.entries, function(el) { return parseEntry(el); });

		if(mostRecentDate != null) {
			entries = _.filter(entries, function(el) { return el.date &lt; mostRecentDate; });
		}

		if($scope.rssFeed != $scope.originalRssFeed) {
			$scope.articles = entries;
			$scope.originalRssFeed = $scope.rssFeed;
		}
		else
			$scope.articles = _.union($scope.articles, entries);

		$scope.$apply(function() {
			$scope.articles = _.sortBy($scope.articles, function(el) { return el.date; });
		});
	});
};</pre>
This code basically calls another function, parseRSS, that calls a Google API to parse an XML feed. You'll notice that the URL that is passed in through accessing that ng-model we declared above, rssFeed. Using the data, we'll do some manipulation to convert the RSS feed item into an item we care about, then basically just add it to an array of all of the feed items: $scope.articles. [The code is a little longer to determine if the rss feed has been changed since the last time updateModel was called - that's why there are mostRecentDate and originalRssFeed variables. There's also a _filter to remove redundant RSS items (_.union wasn't working due to a unique hash key Angular assigns its objects)]

Finally, you might notice the last few lines:
<pre>$scope.$apply(function() {
	$scope.articles = _.sortBy($scope.articles, function(el) { return el.date; });
});</pre>
It would seem that just the $scope.articles assignment would be enough, but for some reason, this doesn't register with AngularJS on the very first load (it does populate on subsequent loads). If it is wrapped in $scope.$apply, then it seems to ensure AngularJS manually registers or listens to the event.

Now, to keep updating, I'm going to basically just keep clicking that updateButton so updateModel() keeps getting called.
<pre>$(function() {
	var $update = $('#update');
	$update.click();

	//then call every 30 secs
	var timeout = 30000;
	setInterval(function() {
		if(document.activeElement.nodeName != 'INPUT' &amp;&amp; document.activeElement.id != 'rssFeed')
			$update.click();
	}, timeout);
});</pre>
So it will look for new data every 30 seconds and will only fire if the $update text field isn't focused (so it won't fire if the user is in the middle of changing the RSS feed) - I couldn't get Jquery .is(":focus") working, so I used a different work around.
<h2>Allow the user to set items to a "read" state</h2>
Now that we have $scope.articles set up, let's write the HTML to display it.
<pre>&lt;div ng-show='existingArticles()' class='container-fluid margin-bottom'&gt;
	&lt;div class='span12 margin-bottom'&gt;
		&lt;button class="btn" ng-click="markAll()"&gt;Mark all as &lt;span ng-show='allAreRead()'&gt;un&lt;/span&gt;read&lt;/button&gt;
		&lt;button class="btn" ng-click="clearCompleted()"&gt;Clear Read&lt;/button&gt;
		&lt;button class="btn" ng-click="showOrHideAll()"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Toggle Headlines/Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
		&lt;button class="btn" id='toggleTheme'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Toggle Dark/Light Theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div ng-hide='article.cleared' class='span12 read-{{article.read}}' ng-repeat="article in articles"&gt;
		&lt;span ng-click='toggleShow(article)' class='title'&gt;{{article.title}}&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href='{{article.link}}' target='_blank'&gt;{{article.shortLink}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span ng-click="markAsRead(article)" class='markRead'&gt;(Mark as &lt;span ng-show='article.read'&gt;un&lt;/span&gt;read)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;div ng-show='article.show' class='content'&gt;{{article.content}}&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div ng-hide='existingArticles()' class='container-fluid'&gt;
	&lt;div ngclass='span12'&gt;
		You may have read all of the articles... :/ I'll try to load some more...
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
If there are existingArticles (that's a function defined in scope that checks that there exist some non-cleared articles), then the first div.container-fluid with the buttons and articles is shown. If not, then the second div.container-fluid is shown indicating there are no articles currently.

When there are articles, then each article is looped via the ng-repeat, each in its own div.span12. It'll show the title, link, shortlink, and content, and a button to mark the item as "read."

One note is that content is shown when the title is clicked - via the ng-click='toggleShow(article)' - this shows that you can pass in the article item as a parameter:
<pre>$scope.toggleShow = function(article) {
	article.show = !article.show;
};</pre>
<h2>Have a mark and clear read items button</h2>
To mark and clear read items, we just set up buttons and set their ng-click handlers. $scope has a markAll() to mark all read/unread and a clearCompleted(). markAll() makes use of an allAreRead() function which uses Underscore to determine if all of the articles have been marked read. You can see them in the finished Gist, but it's mostly straightforward. markAll() just needs to mark all items as either read=true or read=false. clearCompleted() just needs to set the cleared attribute to true for the read items, and ng-hide will do the rest.
<h2>Be able to toggle a light and dark theme</h2>
To do this, there's a #toggleTheme button. Instead of using AngularJS, I'll just use JQuery to toggle a CSS class on the body tag:
<pre>$(function() {
	var $body = $('body');
	$('#toggleTheme').click(function() {
		$body.toggleClass('dark');
	});
});</pre>

		<title>Keller&#039;s Generous Justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently finished reading Tim Keller's Generous Justice. I had read it around the time that I had graduated, but for some reason didn't remember much of it. After being around my church in Seattle for a few months, things actually started making a lot more sense, after we spent some time talking about how we should treat the poor/use our money. Here are a few of my notes for safekeeping:
<ul>
	<li>The JudeoChristian God separates himself from gods of other religions, because He identifies and chooses to identify with the poor and disabled and immigrants, orphans, and widows. In other religions, the god would typically defend the will of the rich and the powerful - those who could give him more. And so the poor would be forgotten or taken advantage of, but the rich would be respected and adhered to. For God to choose the disadvantaged and marginalized would mean that how we respond to these people is how we would respond to God Himself.</li>
	<li>God backs this up in numerous times throughout the Old Testament, implementing different rules into His law that would advantage the poor and even disadvantage the wealthy - the concept of gleaning (in which the wealthy essentially shared their profit or product with the poor, who still had to work for it), Jubilee (a radical redistribution of wealth and property every 50 years), and debts being erased every 7 years.</li>
	<li>Those in a position of privilege or advantage would (and should) literally disadvantage themselves for the benefit of the poor around them.</li>
	<li>Two schools of thought emerge when questioning how people fall into poverty - one school tends to say they are in that position due to a personal moral failure (they just don't work hard enough), while the other suggests that society is structured in such a way that disadvantages them (they are simply not in a position where they can succeed). Keller argues that poverty is really attributed to a complex relationship between both of these, as well as "calamity," not simply one or the other.</li>
	<li>The New Testament speaks as much to justice as the Old Testament in a consistent manner. God particularly comforts and defends the poor and disadvantaged, but doesn't simply stop there. Jesus arrives on the scene in the same form - born to a poor family, looked down upon by people around Him, and being robbed of a fair trial, which ultimately led to His being put to death, though no one could quite admit what He had done to deserve that penalty. [Some refuse to believe in a God that allows such injustice to take place in the world, but we can't forget that God Himself went through it and identifies not with the highest humans, but the lowest.]</li>
	<li>In terms of doing justice in a public forum, we all bring religious views into our arguments, though we're not to talk about it explicitly. It is, however, impossible to speak of justice and what is right for man, without assuming one knows the purpose of man. In this sense, those who believe in abortion are still just as biased (or "oppressive") as those against it. Those who fight for the right for homosexual marriage do so believing man should be able to do anything that man wants, and that this is what is right for man, while those against simply say it is not right for man to be able to do everything. Both parties make decisions based on inherently religious convictions - and if this is the case, I might as well impose my view as well (there is no situation in which a view is not "imposed" on someone else)</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>
