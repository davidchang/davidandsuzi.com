This week is finals week and graduation weekend!! As I write this, Commencement is going on right now. I decided not to go because I don't see the point of going if my name isn't going to be called. Fireworks don't really motivate me either haha. I also have to find my cap and gown. It's somewhere in my closet. I hope in 5-10 years from now, I'm still really relaxed. 

I finished my last final/jury Tuesday and have so much freedom, I don't even know what to do with it! The past few days had been a blur, I don't remember what I did with my time at all. My mind is still in school mode. I do things in a hurry and feel like I constantly have things to do, but when I take the time to slow down and think, I realize I don't have anything to do! No deadlines, no meetings, no last minute practicing. It's a breath of fresh air! This chapter is coming to a close and I think it is a smooth transition into the next chapter. 

It's weird to think that I may never see my friends ever again once I graduate and get married! I don't know the next time I'll hang out with my bible study girls, interact with my friends and family, or see the little kids who have captured my heart at Wildwood. It definitely hasn't hit me yet.

Although I may miss the things that are behind, I also can't help but be joyful for the things ahead. I can't wait to get married. I am so eager to wear my wedding band! Secretly, I take it out of the box, put it on, and admire how wonderful it looks with my engagement ring...but most importantly, how it will symbolize our commitment to each other in marriage. I'll admit (because I know David won't sacrifice his man card saying this) I can't wait for us to wake up next to each other every morning, I can't wait to cuddle on the couch and watch a movie on a rainy Seattle night, I can't wait to give him a big hug after he comes home from work, and I can't wait to go on dates! I haven't been on a date in so long! I can't wait to eat yummy food, see things I've never seen before, and have a picnic in perfect weather. Most of all, I can't wait for the night we don't have to say goodbye after a date! There is so much freedom in marriage :)
