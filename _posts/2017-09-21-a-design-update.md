Wow, it's been nine months since I last touched this site. Even longer since I last touched the design of it. There's a good reason for that, and an explanation is due, but that's not the purpose of this post. This post is to finally say that I updated the design from its 2014 Bootstrap-styled days to something a bit more modern. I can't take much credit, though, as I just applied the Whiteglass Jekyll theme ([https://github.com/yous/whiteglass](https://github.com/yous/whiteglass)). I took the opportunity to clean up some junk I had inside of Jekyll that didn't belong there, improve some syntax highlighting (though JSX doesn't seem to get parsed correctly), not break any links or Open Graph metadata, and add an "About Us" page, which has never existed on the site.

Just for memory, posting some before/after screenshots:
