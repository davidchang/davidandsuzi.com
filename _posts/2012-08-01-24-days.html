Perhaps the most unfortunate thing about marriage is coming face to face with the realization that I'm not the person I'm supposed to be. Someone else gets access to my flesh, to my dark thoughts and slip ups and selfishness, my embarrassing and shameful mistakes from the past, the sin that only fully emerges behind closed doors. Try as hard as I can - I have to understand how these inadequacies don't quite go away. As I count the days until our wedding and hope that the dwindling number will instill in me an urgency to change... I find that the number itself gives me little reason to change. As we learned in premarital counseling, absolutely nothing changes the moment we say, "I do." [And, at the same time, absolutely everything changes, over time.]

Who is the man that I'm supposed to be? I think I should be a man confident in his own manhood, leading and taking responsibility, protecting and providing, leaving and cleaving, making tough decisions, being on top of things, washing my wife with the Word and loving her selflessly, admitting my mistakes and buying peonies when I needed to apologize. I'm not sure who I thought I would be at this point, 3 weeks to the wedding. I'm sure I thought I would be reading my Bible every day and that my prayer life would be heightened. I'm sure I thought I would have a lot to say about theology and all sorts of random things and that I would know how to cook a few good meals and that I'd understand how to fix something when it broke. I think the problem, though, is that we tend to like the idea of becoming people like this, but we typically have no interest in putting in the work or whatever is required to actually change in that direction. [Or that we have excessive self-esteem and no God-esteem, and we swing fully in the opposite direction - eliminating God from the picture and reducing everything to a matter of our own wills.]

But I guess it's also worth saying that we're never quite ready. I don't think there's a point at which we hit sufficiency and marriage is no longer a ride, no less risky, no less frightening.
