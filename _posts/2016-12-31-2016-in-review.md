Another year. Another year in review post.

I'll break this up into a few overarching categories with recaps of what happened this past year and what I hope happens next year.

### Some big lessons I learned this year:

* relationships take work
* talking about God is very important; talking about normal life stuff and seeing God in those things is just as important
* \[some caveats of course, but\] it's okay to do some things just because you enjoy doing them
* God doesn't owe me walking - and a full life is ultimately not contingent on walking or on positive contributions to society
* I have some new problems with being hyper-competitive
* I still have my old problem of freaking out a lot about work and feeling like I'm underperforming
* the significance of prayer
* sometimes the most effective leadership is hands off

### The most important things I want to do in 2017:

* love God through His Word, prayer, and leading people closer to Him
* love Suzi well and invest in “us” more
* be vocal/unafraid to share my life

### Athletics - 2016

* running
  * I had a hard time staying healthy, and even did physical therapy earlier in the year for my right knee, which started hurting about a year ago (interestingly, right after the Seattle Marathon, but not leading up to it)
  * races
    * ran the Seattle Rock n Roll Half Marathon
      * 1:37:13, 284th overall out of 11k runners (but hadn't run more than 6 miles in 6 months leading up to it, so those last few miles went surprisingly well.. like clockwork)
    * forgot all about the Cinco de Mayo half (but probably wouldn't have done it as I was having knee issues at the time)
    * missed the Seattle Half Marathon due to a broken ankle
  * had some really meaningful late night runs by myself at the Redmond High School track
* basketball
  * CSL
    * played CSL again on the team Panda Express, seeing many of our games go to overtime or come down to the last two minutes, so it was a lot of fun/league had some good parity this year
    * we got some pretty sweet CSBC Panda Express t-shirts (thanks Jay for designing!)
  * ankle injury
    * 10/16 - ankle injury happened. We were down by 20 with like two minutes left, so it didn't even matter. For the first few days, I didn't think it was broken and even managed to walk a little a few days after the incident
    * 10/21 - went to a walk-in clinic after a few people from marriage group peer pressured me into getting it checked out
    * 10/25 - surgery
    * 12/7 - started being weight bearing again
    * 1/18 - 3 months since the injury happened; should be clear to run

### Athletics - 2017

* running
  * Hoping to start working out with a few others from church and get all around stronger. I'm hoping that will translate into better form and running longevity
  * Hopeful to run another full marathon and get back to a point of like 40 mile weeks with 7 minute pace being comfortable. If I'm more serious about weightlifting towards the beginning of the year (with little to no mileage), then I'd be looking at a winter marathon like Portland or Seattle

### Work - 2016

* spent half of the year working on WWW Videos Core Experience and the second half of the year working on a new Videos team
* got pretty stressed out after 1st half performance reviews, feeling like i was notably underperforming and that i might get fired
  * turns out, I got a mediocre performance review, and I was quite content with it
  * also really stressed out over a metrics bug that I caused, but later realized that the bug itself that I had caused wasn't actually that bad
* sporadically attended a weekly internal Christians meeting
* was a summer intern manager
* got involved a little with Draft.js open source
* 2 weeks of training and a few other short 1 or 2 day trips down to Menlo Park headquarters
* Facebook moved into [new Dexter offices](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/facebooks-stunning-new-seattle-office-heres-first-official-look-inside/) and announced some [new offices](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/facebook-gobbles-two-seattle-office-building-rapid-growth-continues/) as well
* did one (only one) Facebook hackathon, but that was right when I had started, so I wasn't able to be that productive
* volunteered with Medical Teams International one day, packaging medical materials, for Facebook's Global Causes Day
* there was the annual Facebook Game Day, where we go play games in a field; I played Capture the Flag and it was pretty humbling. Apparently I'm not really as fast as I thought I was.

### Work - 2017

* share my life with my coworkers more and develop real, organic relationships with them
* be more vocal/opinionated when it comes to both code and product decisions
* be less afraid to ask questions, contribute to internal discussions, and learn from everyone
* be willing to represent myself and my work more appropriately (I tend to undersell myself rather than oversell)
* meet with more Christians at Facebook and determine a calculated framework for evangelism at work
* ship
* don't work too hard - work when I need to work and rest when I need to rest (ie know when to stop working, and improve my focus when I need to be working) (thanks James' mom for the quote)
* get legitimately involved with Draft.js open source

### Books - 2016

* Frank Turek's *I don't have enough faith to be an atheist*
* GK Chesterton's *Orthodoxy*
* Nik Ripken's *Insanity of God*
* Gary Chapman's *Five Love Languages* with Suzi
* Helaine Olen and Harold Pollack's *The Index Card*, on finances and investments
* Dave Bruskas' *Dear Son*
* Tim Keller's *Hidden Christmas*
* maybe CS Lewis's *Mere Christianity* (not sure if this year or lasts)

### Books - 2017

* Tim Keller's *Making Sense of God*
* Maybe Andy Stanley's *Visioneering*
* I'm always open to suggestions! Let me know, my list of books to read is short.

### Ministry/Personal Relationship with God - 2016

* led a Friday night teaching on how I think about outreach, some tips and stories, that sort of thing
* discipled someone (we went through 1 and 2 Thessalonians and about half of Romans)
* worked a little on the CSBC website, moving the server from Illinois to California and finally running some Facebook ads for the church
* small groups
  * UW
    * one of my greatest small group experiences, one that really shaped my thinking about how important it is for a small group to establish a culture of enjoying time together and transparent sharing
    * we would do public worship every time we met, singing a song or two
    * we would do evangelism in some form once a month, as well as evangelism training in some form once a month. we tried a few different approaches and it made sense, as we were always surrounded by people (we met at a dining hall on campus)
      * one of my fondest outreach events consisted of us watching an episode of *Adventure Time*, followed by some questions that I had prepared that actually ended up with some gospel conversations. I had a lot of fun preparing for it. Then we ate at U:Don
  * Redmond
    * also really enjoyed this time together because we generated a bit of momentum, I think because we had a lot of people crammed into a tiny space. We often had food together and we often ended up hanging out late into Wednesday night
  * Beacon Hill
    * this group just started, I'm eager to be a part of it
* had to learn to reconcile/resolve conflict with some people from church, took painfully long to resolve
* have been re-learning the significance of prayer as of the last few months and how critical it is to be praying for the people in your life
* finished reading the Bible straight through for the first time in April (it took me like 3 years though; I'd get stuck somewhere and then just end up reading somewhere else)
* played piano in the worship band at church, but less and less now that we have another pianist. Got a little bit of bass though, and had fun playing jazz at our annual Christmas party
* made some sporadic progress memorizing the book of Romans; in chapter 15 currently (I have at most 3 or 4 chapters at a given point of time), but not really actively working on it anymore
* I relapsed into porn around April after maybe two years :/

### Ministry/Personal Relationship with God - 2017

* continue reading the Bible on a regular basis before work
* make a point of praying daily for the people around me regularly, praying for my small groups' prayer requests on a weekly basis
* keep memorizing Scripture, whether that's Romans or not
* make sure I'm not being timid about sharing my faith with people; if I need to err on a side, I'd rather err on the side of recklessness than silence
* no porn
* befriend a nearby family

### Community - 2016

* house timeline
  * early June - put in our first offer ever, in to a house in Columbia City; we offered like 25k over asking and still lost by like 75k
  * late June - mutual agreement with builders to buy a house
  * mortgage paperwork ends up being very frustrating
  * mid October - actually moved in
* after moving into the house
  * Suzi's sister and two friends from church all moved in with us
  * some really good late night conversations
  * some great meals
  * some great times watching Haikyu!, Boy and the Beast, Deathnote, among other anime
    * fine line, but I think watching more TV helps me experience more emotion than I normally do, and that helps my outlook/attitude towards life
  * some Bible reading together
  * taking Christmas pictures
  * hanging out with Kumamon
* some friends from church moved close to us, like a few blocks away
* guy's appreciation night (Mario Party themed)

### Community - 2017

* read the Bible together as a house
* continue to invest in our small group and have community with one another
* prioritize people over work (my tendency is just to want to get things done instead of just being with people)

### Miscellaneous - 2016

* went to a Veritas Forum at UW
  * had never been to one of these, but I had heard about them/seen some Youtube videos of one with Tim Keller. It wasn't actually as cool as I thought it would be; ended up being more about genetic engineering than blatantly spiritual things
* started Rubik's cubing again, lowest was ~37 average of 5, lowest single run was ~27 seconds
* ditched Evernote for knowledge sharing in favor of Quip and small FB groups
  * I think when you work at Facebook, everything starts to look like a Facebook problem. We made Facebook groups for lots of things, even groups with just 2 people in them
* went to my friend Andrew's wedding in Houston in April

### Miscellaneous - 2017

* be more responsive when it comes to communication (emails, tasks, etc)
* do things that I say that I'll do
* take Suzi on more dates and make sure to celebrate and remember victories more
* make good mistakes

### In Closing

If you read this far, thanks! 2016 wasn't that great of a year for me. I got frustrated with a lot of things. The ankle injury. Mortgage paperwork. Relational conflict. Thinking I might get fired. Having a one dimensional view of God, which was pretty crushing at the time. I continue to hope and pray that God will turn me into the person He wants me to be, and that I won't miss out on Him or His work in 2017.
