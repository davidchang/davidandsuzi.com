Back in Tulsa for the weekend for Aaron and Jennifer's wedding. Midway through the ceremony, I realized that it is important to go to weddings.

Weddings demonstrate a distinct end and beginning. The end of two individuals and the beginning of one couple, one covenant.

Weddings don't just happen. You don't just wake up one morning and get married like it's nothing. You work towards it, prepare your heart for it, weigh your priorities and desires, and ready your lifestyle to adjust. Even if you do none of those things, you at least book the venue, appoint your bridal party, prepare food, and invite people. It can't only be a spur of the moment decision, because it requires time to execute.

Why is this important? Because it signifies that we must be ready. At least for me, I've started to hate the idea of judgment. That's one of the reasons I'm scared of racing again - what if I'm not ready? What if I've gotten a lot slower since my faster days in high school? Fear of judgment is also one of the reasons I hate going to the dentist.

Our actions are not without consequence. We'd often like to think that we can do whatever we want and we won't have to be held accountable, and so we stop testing ourselves and checking that our actions align with what is right. It's easier to be apathetic, especially when right is inconvenient.

With that said - it's important to go to weddings. You realize that what you do isn't just whatever, isn't just what you choose to do with your life. But ultimately, you have to be ready to give an account for what you've done.

To the Christians in Corinth, Paul writes: "Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies" (6:19-20).
