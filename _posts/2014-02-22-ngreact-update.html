<p>
React 0.9 just launched this past week and Pete Hunt opened a Github issue (<a href="https://github.com/davidchang/ngReact/issues/2#issuecomment-35528362">https://github.com/davidchang/ngReact/issues/2#issuecomment-35528362</a>) against me to re-run my benchmark as they suspected I would find a big boost in performance. And I did - I saw a 33% increase just by updating my bower.json, dropping from 803ms to 542ms.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Which kinda got me back into the project. I had written an ngReactComponent directive where you could write the React Component and the directive would render the component from a watcher in the directive. At the time, this was like 67% faster than a naive ng-repeat. With the release of 0.9, this was now 78% faster.
</p>
<p>
And then I wrote a directive called ngReactRepeat that used transclusion to parse through the DOM and dynamically create React Components. But that was like 450% slower than the naive ng-repeat. This blog post will be about some optimization steps I tried.
</p>
<strong>Try 1: shouldComponentUpdate</strong>

<p>
About this time, I started reading stuff about React and what made it so fast. One of the boasting points was that in the render step, React used a Virtual DOM to calculate diffs, and these diffs were used to minimize DOM interaction/manipulation. But before render gets called, there's a component step that you can override called shouldComponentUpdate that determines if render should be called at all, based on if there's any change in component state/properties.
</p>
<p>
Since I was passing around some pretty big objects, I thought maybe performance could be improved if I specifically told shouldComponentUpdate that it only needed to look at my array of 5 floats. No improvement. React does a good job out of the box.
</p>
<strong>Try 2: Stop calling React.DOM using apply</strong>

<p>
Most of the examples look like:
</p>
<pre>
React.DOM.div(null, "Hello ", this.props.name);
</pre>

<p>
Since I was recursively/dynamically generating the children, I was doing stuff like this anytime I was creating a React Component:
</p>

<pre>
return React.DOM[domEl.localName].apply(
  null,
  [attrs].concat(
    vals,
    childrenNodes
  )
);
</pre>

<p>
But @vjeux said I could get away with just providing a variable number of arrays as parameters, so I could do something like this:
</p>
<pre>
return React.DOM[domEl.localName](
  attrs,
  vals,
  childrenNodes
);
</pre>

<p>
I thought this might be faster, but it actually wasn't at all. In fact, after getting the optimization in Try 4, I went back and tried it again. And performance went from 3 seconds with apply down to 4 without apply.
</p>
<strong>Try 3: Don't pass scope as a property to the React component</strong>

<p>
One thing I didn't realize about Angular was that you can retrieve the controller scopes through DOM elements. You just have to do something like $($0).scope() and you're looking at the scope used to render the view.
</p>
<p>
I had been passing around the Angular scope through like 3 layers of React components for my array of 500 5-element arrays. So that scope was holding all of that data, as well as a bunch of internal Angular stuff. There was a hunch that passing around the scope was making everything slow - and since I could just pull it off of a DOM element, I could just pass around a DOM ID or something.
</p>
<p>
So I stopped passing the scope around and instead just started using something like $scopeEl.scope() to pull it off when I needed it. And… no improvement. Apparently passing around the large scope object is pretty negligible. Good to know, but that doesn't help our performance. Again, React does a good job out of the box.
</p>
<strong>Try 4: Use scope.$eval > eval</strong>

<p>
Another thing I realized about Angular is that it evaluates a bunch of expressions, but it's not using eval - they're using their own service, which they expose to you in $scope.$eval.
</p>
<p>
So I could stop using eval and just do $scope.$evals instead. This was used in two different places - for each render, I was doing 2500 evals to evaluate ng-bind values and 500 evals to create the ng-click function properly.
</p>
<p>
I did the ng-bind first, which looked like this:
</p>

<pre>
var defineValue = _.ngReactFormat(
  'var {0} = {1}; var value = {2};',
  [
    scope.alias,
    JSON.stringify(data),
    _.ngReactBracketNotation(attrs['ng-bind'])
  ]
);

eval(defineValue);
return value;
</pre>

<p>
and turned it into this single line:
</p>

<pre>
return scope.$eval(attrs['ng-bind'], { scope.alias : data });
</pre>

<a href="../imgs/ngReactUpdate/valueEval.png"><img class='img' src="../imgs/ngReactUpdate/valueEval.png"/></a>

<p>
All of a sudden… 12.5 seconds down to 5.28. 57% faster.
</p>
<p>
Then I tried replacing the ng-click evaluation. It had looked like this:
</p>

<pre>
var defineHandler = _.ngReactFormat(
  'var {0} = {1}, handler = scope.$apply.bind(scope, scope.{2}.bind(null, {3}));',
  [
    scope.alias,
    JSON.stringify(data),
    fnName,
    fnParams
  ]
);

eval(defineHandler);
attrs.onClick = handler;
</pre>

<p>
and ending up like this:
</p>

<pre>
attrs.onClick = function() {
  scope.$apply(function() {
    scope[fnName](scope.$eval(fnParams, { scope.alias : data }));
  });
};
</pre>

<a href="../imgs/ngReactUpdate/clickEval.png"><img class='img' src="../imgs/ngReactUpdate/clickEval.png"/></a>

<p>
5.28 down to 3.01... that's another 43% improvement. And if you remember the original Angular ng-repeat performance, that came out as 2.45 seconds. So we're almost at native Angular performance in a case where we're actually transcluding and dynamically parsing out all of the elements into React components.
</p>
<p>
High five! 13.4 seconds down to 3.01 is something worth celebrating, even if it was mostly my folly in the first place.
</p>
<p>
But this isn't entirely too fair to Angular. Another thing I learned was that ng-repeat performance seems to struggle so much because it does a lot of work destroying elements… which you'll notice is the very thing that React excels at doing. React is very good at calculating DOM diffs and minimizing DOM manipulation.
</p>
<p>
But "track by" exists, so you can do stuff like ng-repeat="row in data track by $index" and Angular will be able to get significantly smarter about the way they do DOM manipulation. Adding track by to that normal, native ng-repeat results in a pretty stunning improvement (as of Angular 1.2.14):
</p>

<a href="../imgs/ngReactUpdate/withTrackBy.png"><img class='img' src="../imgs/ngReactUpdate/withTrackBy.png"/></a>

<p>
That's 400 milliseconds. Compared to 2.45 seconds without "track by". So… umm.. 84% faster. So if you're wondering if you should use track by, the answer is Yes.
</p>

<p>
In closing, I think it is worth pointing out that the problems with ngReactRepeat were not related to a weakness in React. In fact, 2 of my attempts to improve performance (through shouldComponentUpdate and limiting the properties I was passing into the React component) showed no improvement. In the end, it was just my own mistake in using expensive evals.
</p>

<p>
Angular gives you a ton of functionality out of the box - a full MV* framework - and I am a big fan, but I'll admit that you need to know how to twist the right knobs to get performance.
</p>

<p>
That said, React gives you a very strong view component out of the box with the performance baked right in. Try as I did, I couldn't actually get it any faster. So pretty impressive stuff.
