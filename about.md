![David and Suzi, after 5 years!]({{ site.url }}/imgs/about/aboutUs.jpg)

## David and Suzi

We are currently living in South Seattle. We've been together for more than 10 years! Throughout the week, you'll find us hanging out at home with our friends, doing activities with our kids, and being a part of our church community.

We have two daughters, so much of our time is spent hanging out with them and teaching them new things. I also drink about twice as much coffee as before.
